            Here are the main takeaways from yesterday's lesson.
            Can you think of any other important points?
            
            - Data is stored in tables
            - Data in tables in normalized
            - Data is accessed using SQL 
            - Data consistency / integrity is maintained by Constraints
            - Relationships between tables are defined by
            Foreign Key / Primary Key references
            ]

              # Constraints in Detail
              
              Here is an example of a constrain we've added to a table in our Database: 
              
              ```sql
              TEXT NOT NULL
              ```
              Constraining our columns ensures that any data we add to our database is consistent.
              
              - What other constraints are present on the columns in tables we created?<br/>
              - Why are constraints important?
              
              .footnote[.red[*]
                 constraints can be written in ALL CAPS or lowercase
              ]
              
              ???
              
              Constraints we've created:
              
              - text DEFAULT null
              - number references items (itemid)
              - number references tags (tagid)
              - unique (itemid, tagid)
              - serial primary key
              - text not null

              # Exercise 1
              
              Add the appropriate constraints to your project's database.
              
              - What fields in our tables should be unique?
              - What are the specific types of data we're storing in each column?
              - Do we need to initialize any default values in our tables?
              - How can we check if the data being sent by client applications for storage is valid?

              #### A Primary Key is the column that will be used as a reference in other tables of related data.
              A Primary Key is defined by adding the PRIMARY KEY constraint to a specific column in your table.
              
              - Can a table have more than one Primary Key?
              - Does a Primary Key have to be unique for each record (row) in your table?

              Get to know Constraints. Take a moment and review the Postgres documentation on constraints:

              Now that we have our data and relationships set up. Let's write some SQL queries.
              
              - Write a query that returns all of the tags for a given Item.
              - Write a query that returns the number of Items in the database.
              - Write a query that returns the average number of Items which are tagged in your database.
              - Write a query that returns the 5 newest Items.

              # Environment Variables
              
              In Express, we'll need to provide values to our application that will be used at runtime.

              # `process.env`
              
              Here is the code we'll use to connect Express to our environment.
              This example contains the necessary configuration for connecting to Postgres. 
              You should replace `boomtowndemo` with the values you set for your own database.
              
              ```js
              
                app.set('PGUSER', process.env.PGUSER || 'boomtowndemo');
                app.set('PGPASSWORD', process.env.PGPASSWORD || 'boomtowndemo');
                app.set('PGDATABASE', process.env.PGDATABASE || 'boomtowndemo');
                app.set('PGHOST', process.env.PGHOST || 'localhost');
              
              ```
              
              Where should this code be written? <br/>
              What other Environment variables doe we need?
              
              
              ???
              
              Code should be written in a file called configs.js with the following export
              
              ```js
              export default function(app) {
                app.set ...
              }
              ```
              
              And imported into the main `index.js` file
              
              ```js
              import initConfigs from './configs
              initConfigs(app);
              ```
              
              Full config:
              
              ```js
              app.set('DEV_JSON_SERVER', 'http://localhost:3001');
              app.set('DEV_WEB_SERVER', 'http://localhost:3000');
              
              app.set('FIREBASE_API_KEY', ...
              app.set('FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN', ...
              app.set('FIREBASE_DB_URL', ...
              app.set('FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID' ...
              app.set('FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET' ...
              
              app.set('PGUSER', process.env.PGUSER ...
              app.set('PGPASSWORD', process.env.PGPASSWORD ...
              app.set('PGDATABASE', process.env.PGDATABASE ...

              Once you've added it, add the following code to your Connection Pool instance configuration object:
              
              ```js
              user: app.get('PGUSER'),

              database: app.get('PGDATABASE'),
              password: app.get('PGPASSWORD')
