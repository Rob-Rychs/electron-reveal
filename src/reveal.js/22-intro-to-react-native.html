              # What It Is Not...
              
              RN is **not like Cordova** (PhoneGap, Ionic, etc.), which allows you to build something that looks like a native app wrapped in a chromeless web browser in webview inside of a native app (these are known as hybrid apps).
              
              RN is also **not an HTML5 app or progressive web app**.
              
              And it's **not the only non-webview-based cross-platform** game in town, for example, you could also use also NativeScript (AngularJS/free), Xamarin (#C/freemium), and Appcelerator (JS/paid).
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # So What Is It?
              
              React Native is an open-source (BSD-licensed) framework developed by Facebook.
              
              It uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps, but we get to **use JS and React to build truly native mobile apps** (instead of Objective-C, Swift, or Java).
              
              On top of that, RN also offers an (arguably) **better developer experience** and **cross-platform potential** than entirely native approaches.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # How Does It Work?
              
              RN works because its **bridge** creates an interface between React and the host platform's native UI elements and APIs:
              
              .inline-images[
                ![React Native bridge diagram](/public/img/slide-assets/rn-bridge.jpg)  
              ]
              
              ???
              
              - The bridge is all about native call JS and JS calling native
              - So an RN iOS app, the browser's DOM is replaced with UIKit
              - Characteristics of the bridge:
                - Asynchronous
                - Batched (the native calls)
                - Serializable (the messages between JS and native)
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              .large[
              ![React Native threads diagram](/public/img/slide-assets/rn-threads.svg)  
            ]
            
            ???
            
            - The main/native thread launches app and deals with native UI
            - The JS thread is where the JS VM runs entirely
            - There's also a shadow queue (GCD Queue) where some layout concerns are take care of (e.g. flexbox properties, height, width)
            - Native modules can also create their own threads
            
            - Everything always starts on the native side
            - Native decides "I want to run this application now" and sends a call across the bridge to the app entry point
            - The call is serialized via a custom protocol
            - It kicks off `AppRegistry.registerComponent()`
            - Leads to a bunch of calls in JS, which can be calls back into native, e.g. the `UIManager` module
            
            - Touch events always start in native too
            - Call goes across bridge to JS thread to run application code to handle the event and set state, render, etc.
            - The JS side then dispatches view updates
            - The UI updates then happen on the main thread (this can happen at 60fps too)
            
            - The key here is that **JS is driving all the interactions and describing the UI**...because all events are routed through JS
            - And this is the point of React! (`UI = f(data)`)

              # Rendering to the DOM
              
              Recall that when we use React, we also need to include the `ReactDOM` module to render our components to the DOM:
              
              ```js
              import React, { Component } from 'react';
              import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
              
              class App extends Component {
                 render() {
                    return (
                       <h1 id="title">Hello, world!</h1>
                    );
                 }
              }
              
              ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Rendering with RN
              
              Our approach to building a React Native components is noticeably similar, but we import the `AppRegistry` module instead of `ReactDOM`:
              
              ```js
              import React, { Component } from 'react';
              import { AppRegistry, View, Text } from 'react-native';
              
              class App extends Component {
                render() {
                  return (
                    <View>
                      <Text>Welcome to React Native!</Text>
                    </View>
                  );
                }
              }
              
              AppRegistry.registerComponent('App', () => App);
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Why Do It This Way?
              
              - You can build **cross-platform** native apps using your existing JS/React skills (no Objective-C, Swift, or Java required!)
              - Maximizes potential **code re-use** (even between web apps)
              - There's a large (and growing!) **community** around it
              - RN allows you to **recompile your apps instantly** (With HMR! And a better debugging experience!!)
              - You can still **drop into native code** if you need to (e.g. to leverage APIs that aren't exposed in RN by default)

              # Dev Environment
              
              Before we can create our first React Native app, we must ensure we have the following tools installed:
              
              1. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
              2. [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
              3. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
              
              You will likely also want to install a VS Code extension called **[React Native Tools](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native)** and the **[React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger)**.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Your First RN App
              
              Then we can run:
              
              ```bash
              brew install watchman # a tool for watching changes in the filesystem
              npm install -g react-native-cli # the React Native CLI
              ```
              
              Now we're ready to create our first RN app!
              
              ```bash
              react-native init HelloWorld # go get a coffee now...
              cd HelloWorld
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Your First RN App
              
              You're now ready to open your new project in VS Code.
              
              You can start the RN Packager Server from with VS Code by typing `⌘ + ⇧ + P` and picking **React Native: Start Packager**.
              
              From your project directory, now run:
              
              ```bash
              react-native run-ios
              ```
              
              You can also add the `--simulator="iPhone SE"` flag to that command to launch your app on a specific device.
              
              ???
              
              - The "packager" is a Node.js server (on localhost:8081 by default)
              - It's is a local dev server that serves all of the JS you need to run your app
              - Because you don't need to rebuild the native code in your app when you make a change to your JS, this approach allows you to rebundle and refresh your app very quickly
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # What's in There?
              
              The generated directory structure for your project will include:
              
              ```bash
              |-- __tests__        # for Jest tests
              |-- android/         # boilerplate for Android
              |-- index.android.js # entry point for your app
              |-- index.ios.js     # entry point for your app
              |-- ios/             # boilerplate for iOS
              |-- node_modules     # yes, we can use npm packages with RN!
              |-- package.json     # obviously...don't leave home without it
              |-  # ...            # other RN config files...
              ```
              
              For now, we will work primarily in `index.ios.js`, but will talk more in depth about project organization later in the lesson.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Digging Deeper
              
              But how does RN know what component to bind to the view when our app launches? In our `index.ios.js` file we have:
              
              ```js
              AppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWorld', () => HelloWorld);
              ```
              
              And if we look in `ios/AppDelegate.m` we'll see:
              
              ```objective-c
              RCTRootView *rootView = [[RCTRootView alloc] initWithBundleURL:jsCodeLocation
                moduleName:@"HelloWorld"
                initialProperties:nil
                launchOptions:launchOptions];
              ```
              
              For Android, we would see the Java equivalent in the `MainActivity.java` file.

              - RN has a built-in inspector, perf monitor, etc.
              - To view iOS simulator logs from the CLI, you can run `react-native log-ios`
              - The red screen of death will often point you in the right direction...but not always
              - The third-party [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) is essential for debugging your React and Redux code

              # Mobile Components
              
              In React, we can use any HTML element we like to structure our components. But with RN we are no longer dealing with the browser DOM. We must use RN's special, built-in components to create mobile interface elements, such as:
              
              - `<View>` (like `<div>`)
              - `<Image>` (like `<img>`)
              - `<Text>` (like `<p>` or `<span>`)
              - [...and more!](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Mobile Components
              
              *Before we proceed...*
              
              Unlike HTML elements, RN's built-in mobile UI components are modules we must selectively import from `react-native` wherever we want to use them in our own components:
              
              ```js
              import React, { Component } from 'react';
              import { Image, Text, View } from 'react-native';
              
              // ...your component goes here
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # View and Text
              
              The `<View>` [(ref)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view.html) component is a general container to support layout, while `<Text>` [(ref)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/text.html) is an all-purpose component for displaying text.
              
              ```js
              <View>
                <Text>RN for life.</Text>
              </View>
              ```
              
              Note that there are no analogous components for `<em>` and `<strong>`, so adding bold and italics to text will require the application of actual styles (more on that to come...)
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Image
              
              The `source` prop of an `<Image>` [(ref)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/image.html) component can point to an image asset bundled with your app, or an external image. 
              
              Be sure to supply `@2x` and `@3x` versions if possible for static image resources. For network images **you must specify the height and width**.
              
              ```js
              <Image
                style={% raw %}{{ width: 300, height: 200, }}{% endraw %}
                resizeMode={"contain"}
                source={% raw %}{{uri:'https://unsplash.it/600/400/?random'}}{% endraw %}
                // source={require('./img/puppies.png')} A LOCAL IMAGE!
              />
              ```

          <section data-markdown>
              # Image
              
              Also note that `<Image>` components do not need to be self-closing in RN! 
              
              You wrap opening and closing `<Image>` tags around another component, then easily absolutely position the inner component on top of the image.
              
              ```js
              <Image
                style={% raw %}{{ width: 300, height: 200, }}{% endraw %}
                source={% raw %}{{uri:'https://unsplash.it/600/400/?random'}}{% endraw %}
              >
                <Text>Some text...</Text>

              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # TextInput
              
              We may also want users to enter text into a `<TextInput>` [(ref)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/textinput.html) at some point...
              
              ```js
              <TextInput
                style={% raw %}{{ height: 30, width: 100, borderWidth: 1, 
                  borderColor: "rgba(0,0,0,0.5)"}}{% endraw %}
                placeholder={'Type here'}
                placeholderTextColor={"rgba(198,198,204,1)"}
                onChangeText={(text) => {this.setState({text})}}
                onSubmitEditing={() => {this.setState({text: ''})}}
                value={(this.state && this.state.text) || ''}
              />
              ```
              
              Notice the built-in props that are available on listening to changes on the component.

              To change reduce an element's opacity on press, `<TouchableOpacity>` [(ref)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/touchableopacity.html):
              
              ```js
              <TouchableOpacity
                onPress={() => {}}
                activeOpacity={75 / 100}>
                <Text>Press me!</Text>
              </TouchableOpacity>
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # TouchableHighlight
              
              To highlight an element on press, use `<TouchableHighlight>` [(ref)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/touchablehighlight.html):
              
              ```js
              <TouchableHighlight
                onPress={() => {}}
                activeOpacity={75 / 100}
                underlayColor={"rgb(210,210,210)"}
              >
                <Text>Press me!</Text>
              </TouchableHighlight>
              ```
              
              This differs from `<TouchableOpacity>` because an underlay colour is added that tints the view. The underlay comes from adding a view to the view hierarchy, which can cause visual weirdness sometimes.

              # ScrollView
              
              By default your views will not be scrollable (i.e. they will be limited to the fixed size of the mobile device screen). 
              
              You will need a `<ScrollView>` [(ref)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/scrollview.html) component to create scrolling views:
              
              ```js
              <ScrollView>
                <Text style={% raw %}{{fontSize:96}}{% endraw %}>Scroll me plz</Text>
                <Text style={% raw %}{{fontSize:96}}{% endraw %}>i haz</Text>
                <Text style={% raw %}{{fontSize:96}}{% endraw %}>so much big txt</Text>
              </ScrollView>
              ```

              Your turn! Go to the [React Native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and find at least one other mobile component that we haven't discussed yet to try out. Add it to your `HelloWorld` app.
              
              Be creative and come up with a cool demo for the class.

              # Styling Components
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # How Styles Work
              
              There is no CSS in RN per se&mdash;but we will style components using JS that looks a lot like the CSS we're used to though.
              
              RN also supports a **smaller subset of properties** than normal CSS. You can see a [list of those properties here](https://github.com/vhpoet/react-native-styling-cheat-sheet).
              
              In RN, we have a few options for adding styles to components:
              
              - Inline styles
              - Styling with objects
              - `StyleSheet.create`
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Inline Styles
              
              We can use inline styles with RN just as we can with React:
              
              ```js
              render() {
                return (
                  <View style={% raw %}{{flex: 1, alignItems: 'center'}}{% endraw %}>
                    <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
                  </View>
                );
              }
              ```
              
              Generally, inline styles should be **avoided as much as possible** because they are less efficient than other options (as these styles will be recreated with each render pass).
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Styling with Objects
              
              We can also create objects that contain blocks of re-usable styles to keep things more organized and modular:
              
              ```js
              let styles = {
                container: {
                  flex: 1,
                  justifyContent: 'center',
                  alignItems: 'center',
                }
              }
              
              <View style={styles.container}>
                <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
              </View>
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # StyleSheet.create
              
              RN also provides us `StyleSheet.create` as bit of optional syntactic sugar for creating our style objects (but this is likely the way we'll usually want to do it).
              
              The previous style objects occasionally offer an advantage over the `StyleSheet.create` though, because style objects allow our style to be mutable (which may be desirable when using modules such as the `PanResponder`).
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # StyleSheet.create
              
              **Example:**
               
              ```js
              import React, { Component } from 'react';
              import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
              
              export default class HelloWorld extends Component {
                render() {
                  return (
                    <View style={styles.container}>
                      <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
                    </View>
                  );
                }
              }
              
              const styles = StyleSheet.create({
                container: {
                  flex: 1,
                  alignItems: 'center',
                },
              });

              # Layouts with RN
              
              RN supports Flexbox for layouts, with some small differences:
              
              - `flexDirection` column defaults to `column` (not `row`)
              - `alignItems` defaults to `stretch` (not `flex-start`)
              - the `flex` property only supports a single number (e.g. `flex: 1`)
              
              We also use CSS positioning in our layouts (e.g. `absolute`), but floats are not supported. The usual box model properties are available as well.

              # Lists and RN
              
              React Native provides three different components for tranforming data into lists in your app UI:
              
              - [ListView](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/listview.html) (older)
              - [FlatList](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist.html) (simpler)
              - [SectionList](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/sectionlist.html) (more features)
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # FlatList & SectionList
              
              A list view (generally) is a common UI pattern in mobile apps. Think of it like a `<ScrollView>` with benefits.
              
              The `<FlatList>` [(ref)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist.html) or `<SectionList>` [(ref)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/sectionlist.html) expects you to insert some kind of (potentially very large) data blob into it, and it will display that data much more efficiently than a basic `<ScrollView>` could. Performance FTW.
              
              To use either, you will need some data (in array format), a component to render each list item, and way to apply a unique key to each list item.

              # FlatList
              
              Setting up `<FlatList>` in a component:
              
              ```js
              constructor() {
                super();
                this.state = { data: ['Thing 1', 'Thing 2'] };
              }
                
              render() {
                return (
                  <FlatList
                    data={this.state.data}
                    renderItem={({ item }) => <View><Text>{item}</Text></View>}
                    keyExtractor={(item, index) => index}
                  />
                );
              }
              ```
              
              Note that `item` is destructured out of the **[info object parameter](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist.html#renderitem)** of `renderItem`.

              # Fetching Data
              
              We often want to populate a list view with external data.
              
              Let's start by setting a state property to hold the data for the `FlatList` once fetched:
              
              ```js
              constructor() {
                super();
              
                this.state = {
                  data: [],
                  isLoading: true,
                };
              }
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Fetching Data
              
              Then we'll fetch our data, and update state with it:
              
              ```js
              componentDidMount() {
                let endpoint = 'https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos';
              
                fetch(endpoint)
                  // if fetch is successful, read our JSON out of the response
                  .then(response => response.json())
                  .then(data => {
                    this.setState({ data });
                  })
                  .catch(error => console.log(`Error fetching JSON: ${error}`));
              }
              
              componentDidUpdate() {
                if ( this.state.data && this.state.isLoading ) {
                  this.setState({ isLoading: false });
                }
              }
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Fetching Data
              
              Finally, we'll render our data in our component:
              
              ```js
              render() {
               if (this.state.isLoading) {
                return (
                 <ActivityIndicator animating={true} size="small" color="black" />
                );
               } else {
                return (
                 <FlatList
                  data={this.state.data}
                  renderItem={({ item }) => <View><Text>{item.name}</Text></View>}
                  keyExtractor={item => item.id}
                 />
                );
               }
              }
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Other Features
              
              Customizable things in a `<FlatList>` (or `<SectionList>`):
              
              - Add a separator (between list items, excluding the last)
              - Add a header (or sticky header) to the top of your list (a search box maybe?)
              - Add a footer (perhaps a Load More button?)
              - Add pull to refresh or scroll loading functionality
              - `SectionList` only: add a sticky header for each section of your list (where have we seen this pattern?)
              
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # SectionList Data
              
              The `<SectionList>` component is very similar to the `<FlatList>`, but the data will need to be a different shape, and will be set on the `sections` prop instead:
              
              ```js
              <SectionList
                sections={[
                  {title: 'ADP', data: ['Bob', 'Alice']},
                  {title: 'WDP', data: ['Anne', 'Mary', 'Joe']},
                ]}
                renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item}</Text>}
                renderSectionHeader={({ section }) => <Text>{section.title}</Text>}
              />
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Exercise 3
              
              Now you're going to build a slightly more complex `<FlatList>` in your `HelloWorld` app to display a list of users.

              Our project organization plan of attack:
              
              - Reuse as much code as possible (esp. cross-platform)
              - Keep configuration out of code

              # Project Folder
              
              We won't want to depend on `index.ios.js` and `index.android.js` exclusively as our app grows. Let's add a directory to house all of our RN code called `app`:
              
              ```bash
              |-- __tests__
              |-- android/
              |-- js/ # <----------- ADD THIS DIR!
              |-- index.android.js
              |-- index.ios.js
              |-- ios/
              |-- node_modules
              |-- package.json
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Project Folder
              
              Inside the `app` folder...
              
              ```bash
              |-- js/
              |   |-- components # smaller chunks of reusable, stateless UI
              |   |-- config     # keep configuration out of code!
              |   |-- assets     # static image assets and custom fonts
              |   |-- lib        # general functions (code re-use FTW!)
              |   |-- redux      # store and reducers go here
              |   |-- navigation # define routes and nav components
              |   |-- scenes     # container components that render each scene
              |   |-- index.js   # single entry point of a cross-platform app
              ```
              
              You will import `index.js` into `index.ios.js` and `index.android.js` and pass your top-level component into `AppRegistry.registerComponent()` to register your app.

              ```js
              import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
              import HelloWorld from './app';
              
              AppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWorld', () => HelloWorld);
              ```
              
              In `app/index.js`:
              
              ```js
              import React, { Component } from 'react';
              import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
              
              export default class HelloWorld extends Component {
                render() {
                  return (
                    <View><Text>Welcome to React Native!</Text></View>
                  );
                }
              }

              # Configuration
              
              What to put in your `config` folder:
              
              ```bash
              |-- config/
              |   |-- models.js # for defining our Realm db schema later
              |   |-- api.js    # for API details, etc.
              |   |-- styles.js # for shared styles (typography, colours, etc.)
              ```
              
              **Note:** In RN, we typically want to **reuse styled components**, rather than reusing styles. 
              
              However, it usually make sense to set some base styles for our colours and typography (etc.) that can be imported into components throughout our app.

              # Scenes
              
              Each scene of your app will be a container/presentational component combo:
              
              ```bash
              |-- scences/
              |   |-- User
              |   |   |-- index.js
              |   |   |-- styles.js
              |   |   |-- User.js
              |   |   |-- UserContainer.js
              ```
              
              And in the `index.js` we follow this pattern:
              
              ```js
              import UserContainer from './UserContainer';
              import User from './User';
              
              export { User };
              export default UserContainer;
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Components
              
              Use can use a similar directory structure for our reusable, stateless UI components:
              
              ```bash
              |-- components/
              |   |-- UserAvatar
              |   |   |-- index.js
              |   |   |-- styles.js
              |   |   |-- UserAvatar.js
              ```
              
              In `index.js`:
              
              ```js
              import UserAvatar from './UserAvatar';
              
              export default UserAvatar;
              ```
