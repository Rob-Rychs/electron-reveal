          ## If you think about a normal decision process, it usually proceeds in four steps:
          
          - you encounter a choice
          - you analyze your options
          - you make a choice
          - you live with it

          And what we've seen here is that there is a villain that affects each of these stages:

            # Chapter 1 
            
            "A remarkable aspect of your mental life is that you are rarely stumped" -Danny Kahneman
            
            What's in our spotlight = the most accessible information + our interpretation of that information. But that will rarely be all we need to make a good decision. 
            
            Process matters more than analysis.            
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Villain 1: Narrow framing (unduly limiting options we consider)
            -Can I do this AND that?
          
          Villain 2: The confirmation bias (seeking out information that bolsters our beliefs)
          
          Villain 3: Short-term emotion (being swayed by emotions that will fade)
          
          Villain 4: Overconfidence (having too much faith inn our predictions)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
            The pros-and-cons process won't correct these problems. But the WRAP process will.
            Widen your options
            Reality-test your assumptions
            Attain distance before deciding
            Prepare to be wrong

            # Chapter 2: Avoid a narrow frame
            
            Often our options are far more plentiful than we think.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown data-background-transition="zoom">
              Why do we get stuck in a narrow frame? Focusing on our current options means that other things are in the spotlight.
              
              How do we escape a narrow frame? Think about opportunity cost. Or try the vanishing options test: what if your current options disappeared?
              
              It's easier to spot narrow frame from the outside - watch for it as a decision adviser. "Whether or not" decisions should set off warning bells.

            # Chapter 3: Multitrack
            
            Multi-tracking = considering more than one option simultaneously
            
            When you consider multiple options simultaneously you discover the "shape" of the problem       
          </section>
        <section data-markdown>
            Multi-tracking also keeps egos in check - and it can actually be faster!
            -when you develop only one option your ego is tied to it
            -Eisenhardt's research on Silicon Valley firms: Multi-tracking minimized politics and provided a built-in fallback plan
            
            While decision paralysis may be a concern for people who consider many options, we're pushing for only one or two extra. And the payoff can be HUGE
            
          </section>
        <section data-markdown>
            Beware "sham options"
            -Kissinger: "Nuclear war, present policy, or surrender.‚Äù
            -One diagnostic: If people on your team disagree about the options, you have real options
            
            Toggle between prevention and promotion mindsets
            -prevention focus = avoiding negative outcomes. Promotion focus = pursuing positive outcomes
            -Companies who used both mindsets performed much better after a recession
            
            Push for "this" AND "that" rather than "this OR that"

            ## Chapter 4: Find someone who's solved your problem
            
            When you need more options or feel stuck, look for someone who's solved your problem
            
            Look outside: competitive analysis, benchmarking, best practices
            
            Look inside. Find your bright spots

            ### Chapter 5: Consider the opposite
            
            Confirmation bias = hunting for information that confirms our initial assumptions (which are self-serving)
            
            We need to spark constructive disagreement within our organizations
            -The devil's advocate, murder boards
            -Roger Martin's brilliant question: "What would have to be true for this option to be the very best choice?"
            
            To gather more trustworthy information, we can ask discomforting questions
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
            Caution: probing questions can backfire in situations with a power dynamic
            Extreme disconfirmation: Can we force ourselves to consider the opposite of our instincts?
            -"Assume positive intent" spurs us to interpret someone's actions/words in a more positive light
            
            We can even test our assumptions with a deliberate mistake
            
            Because we naturally seek self-confirming information, we need discipline to consider the opposite.

    <section>
      <section data-markdown>
          ## Chapter 6: Zoom Out, Zoom In
          
          Often we trust the "averages" over our instincts - but not as much as we should
          
          The inside view = our evaluation of our specific situation. The outside view = how things generally unfold in situations like ours. The outside view is more accurate, but most people gravitate toward the inside view. 
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
          If you can't find the "base rates" for your decision, ask an expert.
          -WARNING: Experts are good at estimating base rates but lousy at making predictions
          
          A "close-up" can add texture that's missing from the outside view
          
          To gather the best information, we should zoom out and zoom in. (Outside view + close-ups.)

        # Chapter 7: Ooch
        
        ooching = running small experiments to test our theories. Rather than jumping in headfirst, we dip a toe in.
        
        ooching is particularly useful because we're terrible at predicting the future.
        -Tetlock's research showed that experts' are worse than simple extrapolations from base rates
        
    </section>
    <section data-markdown>
        Entrepreneurs ooch naturally. Rather than create business forecasts, they go out an try things. 
        -Reercher Sarasvathy on attitudes of successful entrepreneurs: "To the extent that we can control the future, we do not need to predict it"
        -Intuit's Scott Cook believes in "leadership by experiment," not by "politics, persuasion and PowerPoint." 
        
        Caveat: Ooching is counterproductive for situations that require commitment

        ## Chapter 8: Overcome Short-Term Emotion
        
        Fleeting emotions tempt us to make decisions that are bad in the long term
        
        To overcome distracting short-term emotions, we need to attain some distance
        
        10/10/10 provides distance by forcing us to consider future emotions as much as present ones:
        
    </section>
    <section data-markdowm>
        Our decisions are often altered by two subtle short-term emotions: (1) mere exposure: we like what's familiar to us; and (2) loss aversion: losses are more painful than gains are pleasant.
        -How many of our organizational truths are ideas that we like merely because they've been repeated a lot?
        
        Loss aversion + mere exposure = status-quo bias
        
        We can attain distance by looking at our situation from an observer's perspective
        -adding distance highlights what is most important; it allows us to see the forest, not the trees
        
        Perhaps the most powerful question for resolving personal decisions is "What would I tell my best friend to do in this situation?"
        
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <section data-markdown>
        ### Chapter 9: Honour Your Core Priorities
        
        Quieting short-term emotion won't always make a decision easy.
        
        Agonizing decisions are often a sign of a conflict among your priorities.
        -core priorities: long-term emotional values, goals, aspirations. What kind of person do you want to be? What kind of organization do you want to build?
        -The goal is not to eliminate emotion. It's to honour the emotions that count.
        
    </section>
    <section data-markdown>
        By identify and enshrining your core priorities, you make it easier to resolve present and future dilemmas.
        
        Establishing your core priorities is, unfortunately, not the same as binding yourself to them
        -MIT study: Managers had done no work on their core priorities in the previous week!
       
    </section>
    <section data-markdown>
        To carve out space to pursue our core priorities, we must go on the offence against lesser priorities.
        -Jim Collins's "Stop-doing list": What will you give up so that you have more time to spend on your priorities?
        -Bregman's hourly beep: Am I doing what I most need to be doing right now?
        
        Widen your options
        Reality-test your assumptions
        Attain distance before deciding
        Prepare to be wrong

  </section>

    <section data-markdown>
        ### Chapter 10: Bookend the Future
        
        The future is not a "point" - a single scenario that we must predict. It is a range. We should bookend the future, considering a range of outcomes from very bad to very good.
        -our predictions grow more accurate when we stretch our bookends outward
        
    </section>
    <section data-markdown>
        ### To prepare for the lower bookend, we need a premortem. "It's a year from now. Our decision has failed utterly. Why?"
        
        ### To be ready for the upper bookend, we need a preparade. "It's a year from now. We're heroes. Will we be ready for success?
    </section>
    <section data-markdown>
        To prepare for what can't be foreseen, we can use a "safety factor."
        -Elevator cable are made 11 times stronger than needed; software schedules include a "buffer factor."
        
        Anticipating problems helps us cope with them. 
        -The "realistic job preview": Revealing a job's warts up front "vaccinates" people against dissatisfaction.
        
        By bookending - anticipating and preparing for both adversity and success - we stack the deck in favour of our decisions.
    </section>

    <section data-markdown>
        ### Chapter 11: Set a Tripwire
        
        In life we naturally slip into autopilot, leaving past decisions unquestioned.
        
        A tripwire can snap us awake and make us realize we have a choice.
        -Zappos $1,000 offer created a conscious fork in the road for new hires
        
        Tripwires can be especially useful when change is gradual
    </section>
    <section data-markdown>
        For people stuck on autopilot, consider deadlines or partitions
        
        We tend to escalate our investment in poor decisions; partitions can help rein that in
        
        Tripwires can actually create a safe space for risk taking. They: (1) cap risk; (2) quiet your mind until the trigger is hit
        
        Many powerful tripwires are triggered by patterns rather than dates/metrics/budgets
        -Peter Drucker Be ready for "unexpected success"
        
        Tripwires can provide a precious realization: We have a choice to make.

# Chapter 12: Trusting the process

Decisions made by groups have an additional burden: They must be seen as fair

    </section>
    <section data-markdown>
        "Bargaining" - horse-trading until all sides can live with the choice - makes for good decisions that will be seen as fair
        
        Procedural justice is critical in determining how people feel about a decision
        
        We should make sure that people are able to perceive the process as just
        
    </section>
    <section data-markdown>
        A trustworthy process can help us navigate even the thorniest decisions
        
        Process isn't glamorous. But the confidence it can provide is precious. Trusting a process can permit us to take big risks, to make bolder choices. Studies of the elderly show that people regret not what they did but what they didn't do
