              #What is a Database?
              
              A database is an organized collection of data. The data is typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality. The process of describing the organization of data in your database is called *modelling*.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              #Why we use Databases?
              
              Think of how we get the information about the weather from the newspaper. Information can be printed but it cannot be continuously updated without printing a new paper. We call this **static** data. 
              
              We've used static data in the form of a JSON file, in our project already. Today we're going to replace static data with a database, which will allow us to update the data in our application **dynamically**, whilst persisting that data.

          <section data-markdown>
              # Relational Databases (RDBMS)
              
              To complete our project application, we'll use a database system called **Postgres**.
              
              The principles of RDBMS systems were first formalized by Computer Science researcher **Edgar F. Codd**.
              
              [Codd's 12 Rules](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/dbms_codds_rules.htm)
              
              ???
              Pause and review Codd's 12 rules from the pre-work reading.
              [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/dbms_codds_rules.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/dbms_codds_rules.htm)
              
              A "Management System" is more than just a database. What are the other components that make up the Postgres RDBMS?

              # Relational Database
              
              A Relational Database is made up of several components, of which the **table** is most significant.  The table is where all the data in a database is stored, and without tables, there would not be much use for relational databases.
              
              ![Table](/public/img/slide-assets/sql-table.png)
              
              *What do Codd's rules say about tables in an RDBMS?*
              
              ???
              Be sure to provide some clarity about "tables". Comparing tables in a relational database to those in common spreadsheet applications like excel is usually sufficient.
              
              Google for a diagram of a large relational system. Find one and show the students the level of complexity inherent in large relational systems.

              # Who is Postgres?
              
              "PostgreSQL is a general purpose and object-relational database management system, the most advanced open source database system. PostgreSQL was developed based on POSTGRES 4.2 at Berkeley Computer Science department, University of California."
              
              *It's Open Source!*
              
              ???
              Take the opportunity to contrast Open Source technology vs proprietary tech, ie Microsoft's MySQL.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Start Using Postgres
              
              Once you've installed the Postgress.app, use the following command to log into the Postgres Shell.
              
              ```
              psql
              ```
              You should see a prompt with your OS username: <br/>
              ('RED' is the name of the user)
              
              ```
              RED=#
              ```
              
              You're connected to the Postgres RDBMS!

              # Get Help
              
              The `psql` shell provides all of the functionality for using our Postgres RDBMS.
              To learn more, type the following command into the shell:
              
              ```
              \?
              ```
              **How do you quit the shell?** (Use `\?` to find th command)
              
              ```
              \h
              ```
              This command will list all of the SQL commands you can use to interact with your Relational Databases!<br/>

              # SQL
              
              The output of the `\h` command lists all of the **SQL** commands we can use to interact with our (yet to be created)
              databases.
              
              **SQL** is the common language used to interact with RDBMS systems that follow Codd's Rules.
              
              How is SQL defined in Codd's rules?
              
              ???
              **How is SQL defined in Codd's rules?**<br/>
              
              Rule 5: <br/>
              *Comprehensive Data Sub-Language Rule* <br/>
              A database can only be accessed using a language having linear syntax that supports data definition, data manipulation, and transaction management operations. This language can be used directly or by means of some application. If the database allows access to data without any help of this language, then it is considered as a violation.

              # Exercise 1
              
              - Create 2 Postgres databases
              We'll use one of these databases to try out new things. The other one we'll use as the official database in our project.
              
              - Use the `CREATE USER <name> WITH PASSWORD <pw>` command to create a new user and configure a password for each database.
              
              This setup is meant to mock a real world database setup, and to give us the opportunity to become familiar with
              creating and authorizing a new Database on your local machine. In a real production setting, our setup would be more complicated.
              
              ???
              
              Encourage the students to use the Postgres Docs as well as the help commands to determine how to complete the exercise.
              
              Commands: 
              
              Start Postgres Shell
              ```
              psql
              ```
              Inside the Shell
              
              ```sql
              CREATE USER <db-user> WITH PASSWORD '<new-password>'
              CREATE DATABASE <db-name>;
              GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <db-name> TO <db-user>;
              ```

          <section data-markdown>
              # More `psql` commands
              
              To list the databases we've created in the previous exercise use the following command from the psql shell:
              ```
              \l
              ```
              To list the new Postgres users we created use the following command from the psql shell:
              ```
              \du

              ### Codd on Normalization
              
              1. To free the collection of relations from undesirable insertion, update and deletion dependencies.
              2. To reduce the need for restructuring the collection of relations as new types of data are introduced, and thus increase the life span of application programs.
              3. To make the relational model more informative to users.
              4. To make the collection of relations neutral to the query statistics, where these statistics are liable to change as time goes by.

              # A Table for Items
              
              First, log into psql using a specific user & database with the following command:
              ```
              psql -U <db-user> -d <db-name>
              ```
              Run the following **SQL** command to create your first table!
              
              ```sql
              CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "items";
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Adding Columns
              
              ```sql
              ALTER TABLE "items" ADD COLUMN itemid TYPE serial;
              ALTER TABLE "items" ADD COLUMN title TYPE text NOT NULL;
              ALTER TABLE "items" ADD COLUMN description TYPE text NOT NULL;
              ALTER TABLE "items" ADD COLUMN imageurl TYPE text NOT NULL;
              ALTER TABLE "items" ADD COLUMN ownerid TYPE text NOT NULL;
              ALTER TABLE "items" ADD COLUMN borrowerid TYPE text NOT NULL;
              ```
              
              Copying and pasting each line into the psql shell allows us to modify the table we created, adding columns with their appropriate data types.

          <section data-markdown>
              # All At Once
              
              ```sql
              CREATE TABLE "public"."items" (
                "itemid" serial primary key,
                "title" text not null,

                "description" text not null,
                "ownerid" text DEFAULT null,
                "borrowerid" text DEFAULT null
              );
              ```

              What does the `serial` datatype do? <br/>
              What does the DEFAULT attribute mean? <br/>
              
              ???
              
              Be sure to stop to talk about the following details:
              
              - serial data type
              - PRIMARY KEY

                "tagid" serial PRIMARY KEY,

              # Relational Relationships
              
              We've created 2 tables in our database. Each table will hold information about a specific *thing* in our application.
              
              Now, it's time to use our Relational Database to create relationships between them! But first it's helpful to know what kind of relationships we can define. Here are the most common: 
              
              - 1 to 1 (1:1)
              - 1 to many (1:n)
              - Many to many (n:n)
              
              ???
              
              Here you can introduce the following relationships among data in the project application:
              
              **Items and Tags share a n:n (Many to many) relationship.** <br/>
              **Users and Items share a 1:n (One to many) relationship.**
              
              We haven't mentioned Users yet. Introduce them now.

          <section data-markdown>
              # Primary Keys in Action
              
              Imagine we're storing Users in our Database (We're going to put users in a separate database and connect them using GraphQL, which we'll talk about later):
              
              ```sql
              CREATE TABLE "public"."users" (
                "userid" serial primary key,
                "name" text not null,
              );
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Primary Keys in Action
              
              In Relational Databases, the PRIMARY KEY is used to define relationships between tables. To relate users to their items,we would use the PRIMARY KEY as follows, when creating the items table:
              
              ```sql
              CREATE TABLE "public"."items" (
                "itemid" serial primary key,
                "title" text not null,
                "imageurl" text DEFAULT null,
                "description" text not null,
                "ownerid" REFERENCES users (userid),
                "borrowerid" REFERENCES users (userid)
              );
              ```
              
              Can you spot the relationship?
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Primary Key Constraint
              
              ```sql
              "ownerid" REFERENCES users (userid),
              "borrowerid" REFERENCES users (userid)
              ```
              These lines are telling Postgres that the values stored in these columns will be references to values stored in the `users` table, namely the userid of actual users.
              
              This is called a **Primary Key constraint**, because no other value can be stored in this column, and it's a common way of defining relationships between tables in a relational database.

              Now that we've created our schema (table) for our project application, use the `INSERT` command to populate your data base with some mock data.
              
              Add the following mock data to your database:
              
              - At least 4 Items
              - All of the Tags (Categories)
              
              Ensure that you've set up the appropriate foreign key constraints!
