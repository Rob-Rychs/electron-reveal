              # Example 1
              
              **What is the output here? Why?**
              
              ```js
              // setTimeout(fn, delay)
              
              function run() {
                console.log('a');
              
                setTimeout(() => {
                  console.log('b');
                }, 100);  
              
                setTimeout(() => {
                  console.log('c');
                }, 0);
              
                console.log('d');
              }
              
              run();
              ```
              
              ???
              
              You can run the example directly in the console.
              
              You will get an `undefined` response before you see `b` and `c` logged. See if they have any idea why.
              
              (The `run` function will return `undefined` on its completion, after which the event loop picks up the `b` and `c` log calls)

              ```js
              function do_a(cb) {
                console.log('a');
                cb('cb');
              }
              
              function do_b() {

              # Handling Errors in Callbacks
              
              To make sure errors are properly handled, many libraries implement **error first** callbacks:
              
              ```js
              get(url, (error, response) => {
                if (error) {
                  return console.log(error);
                }
                console.log('response');
              });
              ```
              
              *Why do you think we put the error first?*
              
              *How would this make callback hell more hellish?*

              # Exercise 2
              
              **Setup (in pairs):**
              
              Create an `async-js` branch in the `esnext-playground`, install the [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) library, and read the API docs for [this fake API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to GET our data.
              
              **Using callbacks, write a function that:**
              
              1. Prints the first 10 Posts
              2. Prints the first 20 Albums
              3. Prints 'Done!'

            Inversion of Control:
            
            - Can anyone think of a bigger issue with the way we're writing code?
            - We've handled errors, but what if the response never comes?
            - We've handed control of our application to some API
            - This principle is called Inversion of Control (IOC)
            
            Reasonability:
            
            - Consider the callback hell example
            - Is it easy to understand, to "Reason About"?
            - When there is a divergence between the way we think and the way our computer thinks, we get bugs

              - Allow us to write code that we can reason abount, and maintain control over
              
              Pre-test:
              
              - Where have we seen promises before? (jQuery AJAX)
              - The "Promise" metaphor: "I promise I'll get back to you"

          <section data-markdown>
              # Promises
              
              Promises use `then` and `catch` to handle success resolution or a rejection, respectively:
              
              ```js
              get(url)
                .then(response => console.log(response));
                .catch(console.log);
              ```
              
              *Where have we used this already?*
              
              ???
              
              - Instead of handing control and asking a function to be called, we're calling a function and expecting a return value.
              
              Bonus:
              
              How does this look in the event loop?
              
              - All `then` and `catch` methods get called, they just register callbacks effectively using closures.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Handling Errors in Promises
              
              If any of the `then` functions fail, then the `catch` function will be called:
              
              ```js
              get(url)
                .then(response => console.log(response));
                .then(response => console.log(response));
                .then(response => console.log(response));
                .catch(console.log);
              ```
              
              ???
              
              - Unhandled promises throw an error
              - What about timeouts? Is this fixed? How might you fix it?
              - You can easily add timeouts into promise calls.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Handling Errors in Promises
              
              **GOTCHA:** Any `then` *after* a `catch` will be called!
              
              ```js
              get(url)
                .then(response => console.log(response));
                .then(response => console.log(response));
                .catch(error => console.log('STOP!'));
                .then(response => console.log(response)); // This will get called!
                .catch(console.log);
              ```
              
              ???
              
              This can make multiple failure flows difficult to code.
              
              - You can return a failed promise with a message `Promise.reject('FLAG')`
              - But there's no good control flow options

              Solution:
              
              ```js
              function getPromise = (url) => {
                return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                  get(url, (error, response) => {
                    if (error) return reject(error);
                    resolve(response);
                  });

              **Setup:**
              
              Install the [Request Promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise) library.
              
              **Using promises, write a function that:**
              
              - Prints the first 10 Posts
              - Prints the first 20 Albums
              - Prints 'Done!'

              # Async Functions
              
              ```js
              async function getUrl(url) {
                try {
                  const response = await get(url);
                  console.log(response);
                } catch (e) {
                  console.log('uh oh!');
                }
              }
              
              getUrl('http://www.google.ca');
              ```
              
              - Any async **or sync** function can be awaited
              - Allows us to write async code that looks synchronous
              - We can only use the `await` keyword in an `async function`
              
              ???
              
              - Async functions are sugar for generators
              - Already in the newest versions of all browsers.
              - No IE or Opera Mini support, still need a transpiler
