						# What is React?

						React is a JavaScript **library** for building user interfaces.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Why Use React?
						
						React makes it easier to reason about, construct, and maintain *stateless* and *stateful* UIs. Specifically, it is:
						
						- **Declarative:** We program the *what* not the *how*
						- **Component-Based:** We build encapsulated pieces of UI to build larger more complex UIs
						- **Learn Once, Write Everywhere:** React makes no assumption about how it will ultimately rendered, so we can use it for SSR with Node or to build mobile apps with React Native too
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Who Uses React?
						
						- Facebook (created it)
						- Instagram
						- Netflix
						- Alibaba
						- Atlassian
						- [...and many more!](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/Sites-Using-React)

							# Key Concepts: Components, JSX & the Virtual DOM							
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
							# Components
							
							Because React is a **component-based view abstraction**, we need to start thinking about our UIs in terms of *components*.
							
							A component may be an input, a button, a list item, etc. It can also be anything wrapping a number of components to create a more complex piece of UI.
							
							We have to think carefully about how we will **manage state** in our components. (Redux will help with this next week.)

							.large[
							**Insight:** React components are the programatic abstraction that makes it possible to create these chunks of UI.
					 ]
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
							# Elements & Components
							
							React elements are simply **JS objects used to describe how the HTML for the component should look **, i.e. it is an object-based representation of a DOM note. There are no methods on the object, just data.
							
							They can be created with plain JS or **JavaScript XML (JSX)**.
							
							Components, on the other hand, are **functions or classes that return React elements.**
							
							We use `ReactDOM.render()` to render a React element into a particular DOM element, and the return value of this method is the React component instance.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
							# React Elements
							
							What a React element looks like:
							
							```js
							// Without JSX
							let helloWorld = React.createElement(
								"div",
								null,
								"Hello World!"
							);
							
							// Using JSX
							let helloWorld = <div>Hello World!</div>;
							
							// Both produce a JS object that looks something like this...
							let helloWorld = {
								key: null,
								props: {
									children: "Hello World!"
								},
								ref: null,
								type: "div"
							};
							```
					</section>
				
				
						<section data-markdown>
								### JSX?
								
								JSX is an XML syntax that can be used to construct the markup in React components.
								
								JSX makes it **easier to read and write** React components in our code, but React does work without JSX too.
								
								---
								class: center, middle
								
								.large[
									 Let's take a closer look at how we would create a React component both ways...

						</section>
						<section data-markdown>
								# Hello World: No JSX
								
								Without JSX...
								
								```html
								<div id="root"></div>
								```
								
								```js
								import React, { Component } from 'react';
								import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
								
								class App extends Component {
									render() {
										return (
											￼￼￼￼React.createElement('h1', {id: 'title'}, 'Hello, world!')
										);
									}
								}
								
								ReactDOM.render(
									 React.createElement(App, null),
									 document.getElementById('root')
								);
								```
						</section>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Hello World: JSX
						
						With JSX now...
						
						```html
						<div id="root"></div>
						```
						
						```js
						import React, { Component } from 'react';
						import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
						
						class App extends Component {
							 render() {
									return (
										 <h1 id="title">Hello, world!</h1>
									);
							 }
						}
						
						ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
						```
						
						*More readable, less typing!*
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Other Things to Note
						
						- We must import the `React` and `ReactDOM` libraries before we can create React components
						- `React` provides us with a `Component` class to extend and create our own components (we can also create *functional stateless components* without the `Component` class)
						- `render` method comes from `Component`, and is required
						- If you want to return React elements on more than one line, you must wrap your return value in `()`
						- Look ma, no quotes! (...because JSX isn't a string)
						
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# JSX Gotchas
						
						- There must be **exactly one outer-most element returned** with your JSX (so you can't return sibling elements, only a parent with children)
						- To add a comment in JSX use: `{/* a comment */}`
						- If you need to add a `class` to an element, you must use `className`
						- If you need to add a `for` attribute, you must use `htmlFor`
						
						*Conintued...*
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# More JSX Gotchas
						
						- Self-closing tags must have a `/` before the `>`
						- Event listener names must be camel case (e.g. `onClick`)
						- JSX must be transformed into real JS to be parsed by ES5 JS engines (we'll use Babel for that)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						Exercise 2
						
						Your turn! Time to create your first React component...
						
						Open a Codepen and try creating a React Component that simply adds the "So Much To Do" `<h1>` to an app.
						
						Note that in Codepen, you don't explicitly import `React` or `ReactDOM`, but you will need to go to the Settings tab in the JS panel to "Quick-add" these libraries to your pen.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# The Virtual DOM
						
						- The virtual DOM is an **in-memory representation of real DOM elements** generated by React components before any changes are made to the page
						- It exists on the top of the DOM or some other render target
						- When changes are made to the virtual DOM, React figures out the best way to **batch those changes** to the underlying DOM structure
				</section>

					]
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Why This Matters
						
						- The DOM wasn't designed for creating dynamic UIs
						- Web apps exist so that users can interact with them in a task-oriented way&mdash;this means that users can/will influence the state of the app, and we need some way to render those changes to the DOM
						- The virtual DOM helps with performance in this regard (versus directly manipulating the DOM)

				<section data-markdown>
						# Software Installation
						
						Facebook makes it easy to configure a build set-up for a basic React app with their **[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)**. To install it globally on your system, run:
						
						`npm install -g create-react-app`
						
						We'll also want to install the **[React Developer Tools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)** to assist with debugging.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# ToDo App Set-up
						
						In the exercises that follow, we're going to create a basic to-do app using React. To create you app, run the following command in an appropriate directory:
						
						`create-react-app react-todo`
						
						Now `cd` into your `react-todo` directory, and run:
						
						`npm start`
						
						You should now be able to access the app on **http://localhost:3000**.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# What We Have Now
						
						A boilerplate React app with:
						
						- Babel transpiling (so we can use ES2015 and JSX)
						- Webpack for bundling
						- ESLint for catching mistakes
						- A development server
						
						*All with zero configuration!!*
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Working with Components
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Conditional Rendering
						
						Sometimes we need to conditionally render content in a component:
						
						```js
						render() {
							let hello = true;
						
							return (
								<div>
									<h1>Awesome App</h1>
									{ hello &&
										<p>Hello, world!</p>
									}
								</div>
							);
						}
						```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Conditional Rendering
						
						Or with if-else:
						
						```js
						render() {
							let hello = true;
						
							return (
								<div>
									<h1>Awesome App</h1>
									{ hello ? (
										<p>Hello, world!</p>
									) : (
										<p>Goodbye, world!</p>
									)}
								</div>
							);
						}
						```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Conditional Rendering
						
						We can be more verbose for clarity:
						
						```js
						render() {
							let hello = true;
							let greeting = null;
						
							if ( hello ) {
								greeting = <p>Hello, world!</p>;
							} else {
								greeting = <p>Goodbye, world!</p>;
							}
						
							return (
								<div>
									<h1>Awesome App</h1>
									{ greeting }
								</div>
							);
						}
						```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Conditional Rendering
						
						This is a bit more compact:
						
						```js
						render() {
							let hello = true;
						
							return (
								<div>
									<h1>Awesome App</h1>
									<p>{ hello ? 'Hello, world!' : 'Goodbye, world!' }</p>
								</div>
							);
						}
						```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Conditional Rendering
						
						React components can also use switch statements:
						
						```js
						render() {
							let myValue = 2;
						
							switch( myValue ) {
								case 1:
									return <div>Only one</div>;
								case 2:
									return <div>More than one</div>;
								default:
									return null;
							}
						}
						```
						
						Returning `null` tells the component not to render.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						Iterating Over Arrays
						
						We will often want to create components that display data by iterating over a list of array items. This is easy to do in React using JS' built-in `.map()` method and an arrow function:
						
						```js
						class App extends Component {
							render() {
								const skills = ['React', 'Angular 2', 'Vue.js'];
						
								return (
									<ul>
										{skills.map((skill, i) => (<li key={i}>{skill}</li>))}
									</ul>
								);
							}
						}
						```
						
						Notice the use of `{}` to wrap JS expressions inside JSX.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Iterating Over Arrays
						
						Wondering what's up with the `key` attribute on the `<li>`?
						
						The `key` attribute helps React keep track of **dynamic children** (i.e. where child items may be added, removed, re-sorted, etc.).
						
						Even if your children aren't going to change in any way, **React will complain** to you in the browser console if you don't add a unique `key` for each item.
						
						**Note:** Using the array item's **index is not ideal** (because these can change), so other unique values should be used for keys if possible.
						
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Exercise 3
						
						Open `App.js` in your React app and delete the default content in the `render()`.
						
						In its place, set up an array as a constant called `todos` and add 'Learn React' as the only item.
						
						Next, use what you just learned about `.map()` and iterating over arrays in a component to list the to-do array item inside an unordered list element.
						
						You can also remove the default logo `import` and delete the file too.
						/section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Types of Components
						
						There are two way we will create components:
						
						1. Using ES2015 classes
						2. Using stateless functions
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# ES2015 Class
						
						We've already seen an example of a React component built using an ES2015 class:
						
						```js
						class App extends Component {
							 render() {
									return (
										 <h1 id="title">Hello, world!</h1>
									);
							 }
						}
						```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown><
					# Stateless Function
					
					In more recent versions of React, we can also build components using this syntax:
					
					```js
					const App = () => {
						return (
							<h1 id="title">Hello, world!</h1>
						);
					}
					
					// Or more succinctly...
					const App = () => <h1 id="title">Hello, world!</h1>;
					```/section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# What's the Diff?
						
						- Stateless functional components allow us to create components that are meant to be **pure functions of their props** (more on props in a moment!)
						- They **do not retain internal state**
						- They do not have the **component lifecycle methods** (i.e. no `render()`, etc.)
						- Later this week we will use ES2015 classes to create **Container Components** and the stateless functional approach to create **Presentational Components**...
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Naming Components
						
						When naming components, the convention is to use **PascalCase**. We also want to make sure we name our components in a way that makes sense given the larger context of our app.
						
						The key is to **be descriptive**, and start with a **base noun** so components can be easily categorized. For example:
						
						```js
						<PostsContainer />  ->  <Posts />
						<Posts />           ->  <PostList />, <Post />
						<Post />            ->  <PostListItem />, <PostDetails/>
						``` 
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Exercise 4
						
						Add CSS to your app by copying the styles from **[the files in this gist](https://gist.github.com/mandiwise/d6c9cb0a6e9edc20e24b6cd973cdb6d7)**, clearing out the default styles in `App.css` and `index.css`, and pasting the copied styles respectively. Also wrap the `<ul>` in a `<div>` with a class of `todo-list` (remember how to treat class attributes in React).
						
						Finally, create a stateless functional component called `ToDo` and move your list item into it, then call `.map()` on the new `<ToDo>` component instead.
						
						Be sure to move the `key` attribute from your `<li>` onto the `<ToDo />` inside the `.map()` function. Your app will be broken now but we'll find out why in a minute!

						# Adding Props

						**Problem:**<br />We have a reference error in the `<ToDo />` component.
				 ]
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						.large[
						**Solution:**<br />Fix it with props!
				 ]
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Props
						
						- **Arguments passed to React components** are called props
						- Props allow us to provide **configuration values** for a given component
						- They look a lot like plain ol' HTML attributes
						- **ES2015 Components:** Arguments passed as props can be accessed using the `this.props` object
						- **Functional Stateless Components:** `props` should be passed in as an argument to the arrow function (or destructuring may be used to access specific props directly)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Props Example
						
						Using a prop allows us to specify a unique greeting for each `<HelloWorld />` component:
						
						```js
						const HelloWorld = (props) => (
							 <h1>{props.greeting}</h1>
						);
						
						// Or with destructuring...
						// const HelloWorld = ({ greeting }) => (
						//    <h1>{greeting}</h1>
						// );
						```
						
						```js
						class App extends Component {
							 render() {
									return (
										 <HelloWorld greeting="Hello world, of course!" />
									);
							 }
						}
						```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Exercise 5
						
						Based on what you just learned about props, fix the reference error in the `ToDo` component.
						
						Specifically, think about how you will pass the `todo` item from the the `App` component to the `ToDo` component as a prop called `item`.
						
						Try using the **destructuring approach** when accessing the `item` prop in the `ToDo` component.
						
						While you're at it, add `<h1>So Much To Do</h1>` to the top of your to-do list to give it a title.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Exercise 6
						
						Our to-do items will need to be a bit more complex than they are. Rather being derived from a simple array of string values, they will need to be derived from an **array of objects** where each object has an `id`, `title`, and `complete` property.
						
						```js
						render() {
							 // const todos = ['Learn React']; REMOVE THIS!
							 const todos = [
									{ id: 0, title: 'Learn React', complete: false }
							 ];
							 // ...
						}
						```
						
						Make this change. Your app will be broken again...what needs to be updated in your `ToDo` component now?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Exercise 7
						
						Our app needs a couple more components. First, create a `ToDoCount` component with a `number` prop to display the number of to-dos in the list **with** the word "todo" or "todos" displayed depending on how many items are present.
						
						Next, create a `ClearButton` component with `removeCompleted` prop. This component's prop will be set to function that will fire on the button's `onClick` event.
						
						Once you've created your new components, add them to your `App` inside of a `<div>` with a class of `todo-admin`. You can pass any integer for the `number` prop and an empty string for the `removeCompleted` prop for now.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# this.props.children
						
						Every component's `props` object has a property named `children`.
						
						Why do we need this? It's because not all components use self-closing tags. For example:
						
						```html
						<HelloWorld>I am a child of HelloWorld.</HelloWorld>
						```
						
						In this example, `this.props.children` would equal "I am a child of HelloWorld."
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# this.props.children
						
						We can also render components inside of other components:
						
						```js
						class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
							render() {
								return (
									<div>
										{this.props.children}
									</div>
								);
							}
						}
						
						class App extends React.Component {
							render() {
								return (
									<HelloWorld>
										<h1 id="title">Hello, world!</h1>
									</HelloWorld>
								);
							}
						}
						```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Proptypes
						
						Proptypes are a feature of React that allow us validate whether props were set on a component as expected, e.g. if a prop:
						
						- is required
						- contains a primitive type
						- is an array containing only items of a specified type
						- is an object with a specific shape
						- satisfies a condition set out in a custom validator
						- **[...etc.](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)**
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Using Proptypes
						
						To use proptypes, you'll need to import `Proptypes` from `prop-types` in your `App.js` file:
						
						```bash
						npm install --save prop-types
						```
						
						```js
						import React, { Component } from 'react';
						import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
						
						class HelloWorld extends Component {
							 // the component's code...
						}
						
						HelloWorld.propTypes = {
							 greeting: PropTypes.string.isRequired
						};
						```
						
						What do you think this `propType` necessitates when using the component?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Default Props
						
						We can also set defaults for our components props, which will take effect if no prop is set where the component is used:
						
						```js
						import React, { Component } from 'react';
						import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
						
						class HelloWorld extends Component {
							 // the component's code...
						}
						
						HelloWorld.propTypes = {
							 greeting: PropTypes.string
						};
						
						HelloWorld.defaultProps = {
							greeting: 'Hello, world!'
						};
						```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Exercise 8
						
						Add proptypes for the `ToDo`, `ToDoCount`, and `ClearButton` components.
						
						We need our `todo` prop to be an object with a specific set of properties, so you will need to use `PropTypes.shape()` for that. Use the React doc's reference on **[Prop Validation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)** to find out how to do this.
						
						Make all of the props for all components **required**.
						
						**Note:** You will end up with a warning in your console for one of your props if you successfully completed the exercise. Why does this happen?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# Looking Ahead
						
						Preparing for tomorrow's exercises, our `ToDo` component will need to be more than a simple list item&mdash;it will need to include a checkbox input as well. Make the following adjustment to the mark-up rendered by the `ToDo` component:
						
						```js
						const ToDo = ({item}) => (
							 <li>{item.title}
									<input
										 type="checkbox"
										 id={item.id}
										 checked={item.complete} />
									<label htmlFor={item.id}></label>
									<button>
										 <i className="fa fa-trash"></i>
									</button>
							 </li>
						);
						```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# To-Do App To-Dos
						
						Tomorrow we will need to:
						
						- Create an input for adding new to-do items
						- Add functions to add and remove to-do items
						- Add a function for marking a to-do as complete
						- Add a function to clear all of the completed to-dos from the list at once
