                  How did state management and data flow work in the todo app last week? Did this feel like the best solution?

                  Challenges:
                  
                  - Passing properties down the tree
                  - Handling local state within a component
                  - Passing callbacks down the tree

                  - That state was was available anywhere within our app?

                  # Three Principles of Redux
                  
                  1. There's a **single source of truth** for all application state
                  2. That state is **read-only**
                  3. Changes to application state are made with **pure functions**
                  
                  ???
                  
                  Single source of truth:
                  
                  - Regardless of the size of the application, all state data is stored in a single object
                  - This makes it much easier to debug or inspect your application!
                  
                  Read-only:
                  
                  - In Redux neither views nor network callbacks mutate state directly
                  - Because we don't mutate the state directly (just copy it and combine it with the updates), this makes it possible to "time travel" through our app state changes in the Redux dev tools
                  
                  Pure functions
                  
                  - We use actions in Redux, which are simple JavaScript objects that express an intent to mutate the state object
                  - Then you write a special function called a reducer to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state
                  - Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                  # Redux Keywords
                  
                  - **Store:** where all your application state lives
                  - **Actions:** how you describe a change to be made to state
                  - **Reducers:** the pure functions that update the store with the new state object
                  
                  ???
                  
                  Redux, in a nutshell:
                  
                  - The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store
                  - The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened
                  - To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers

                  # Premise & Set-up
                  
                  Before we learn how to integrate Redux with React, we're going learn the basics of Redux by improving fruit inventory state management in our grocery store from yesterday.
                  
                  We'll be rebuilding our grocery store from scratch with Redux, so **begin by creating a new directory** for this lesson with an `src/index.js` file in it, create an empty `dist` directory, and then `npm init` in the root directory.

                  # Webpack Installation
                  
                  Install Webpack and its dependencies in your project:
                  
                  ```bash
                  npm install --save-dev babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-stage-0 webpack webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin
                  ```
                  
                  Add scripts to your `package.json`:
                  
                  ```js
                  // ...
                  "scripts": {
                    "start": "webpack && webpack-dev-server",
                    "build": "webpack -p",
                  },
                  // ...
                  ```
                  
                  Also include a `webpack.config.js` file to your project root director too and add the provided snippet.
                  
                  ???

                  # Redux Installation
                  
                  Install Redux:

                  Now start your Webpack dev server:
                  
                  ```

                  # Redux Set-up
                  
                  We will co-locate our related Redux actions, action creators, and reducers in appropriately named files.
                  
                  Create a new directory in `src` called `redux`, and another directory called `modules` within it, and a `fruit.js` module file within that:
                  
                  ```bash
                  mkdir -p src/redux/modules
                  touch src/redux/modules/fruit.js
                  ```
                  
                  ???
                  
                  - Note that we will mostly adhere to the Ducks pattern to structure our Redux code: https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                  # Our First Action
                  
                  Remember that actions plain JS objects that contain payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. Action objects must have a `type` property to indicate the type of action being performed.
                  
                  As a best practice, we define string constants to use as the values for our action object `type` property.
                  
                  So in `fruit.js` add:
                  
                  ```js
                  const GET_FRUIT_COUNT = 'GET_FRUIT_COUNT';
                  ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                  # The Action Creator
                  
                  Now we need an **action creator** to actually create the corresponding action object in `fruit.js`:
                  
                  ```js
                  export const getFruitCount = () => ({
                    type: GET_FRUIT_COUNT
                  });
                  ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                  # Exercise 1
                  
                  Now create action string constants for stocking up fruit and explaining the current fruit stock.
                  
                  Note that the action creator for stocking up fruit will need to be set-up with a parameter of `count` so we can pass some information along in the action's payload about how much to update the inventory in our grocery store state.
                  
                  You can set the value of `count` on a `payload` property in this action object.
                  
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                  # A Bit More Set-up...
                  
                  Before we create our reducer, we'll need to add our initial fruit inventory data to our app, and abstract our prototype methods into helper functions.
                  
                  Create `inventory.js` and add your fruit data as a named export, then add `helpers.js` and add `countFruit`, `stockUp`, and `explain` functions to this file as named exports (based on the work you did yesterday).
                  
                  What modifications will you need to make to these functions to make them into more generic helpers?

                  # What's in a Reducer?
                  
                  Actions describe the fact that something happened, but don't specify how the application's state changes in response&mdash;that's where reducers come in. The basic function signature of a reducer is:
                  
                  ```js
                  export default (state = {}, action) => {
                    switch (action.type) {
                      case SOME_ACTION_CONSTANT: {
                        return {
                          ...state, // not mutating state!
                          someData: action.payload
                        };
                      }
                      default:
                        return state;
                      }
                  };
                  ```
                  
                  ???
                  
                  Remember:
                  
                  - Use pure functions (don't mutate anything!)
                  - Generally built using `switch`
                  - Default to returning the existing state
                  - Set initial state with a default parameter
                  - It's a good idea to think about what shape you want your state object to be before writing any code
                  
                  Things you should never do inside a reducer:
                  
                  - Mutate its arguments
                  - Perform side effects like API calls and routing transitions
                  - Call non-pure functions, e.g. Date.now() or Math.random()

                  Given the same arguments, it should calculate the next state and return it. No surprises. No side effects. No API calls. No mutations. Just a calculation.

                  Now that you've take care of the `GET_FRUIT_COUNT` action in the produce reducer, finish off building out the cases for the `UPDATE_FRUIT_STOCK` and `EXPLAIN_FRUIT_STOCK` action types.
                  
                  How will you ensure that the original and current lists of fruit stocks are added to the store even if the user doesn't fire off the `GET_FRUIT_COUNT` action first?

                  # Combining Reducers
                  
                  Before we create our store, we'll use the `combineReducers` function to combine all of our module reducers into one, even through we only have one right now!
                  
                  Add this to `src/redux/reducers.js`:
                  
                  ```js
                  import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
                  import produceReducer from './modules/produce';
                  
                  export default combineReducers({
                   produce: produceReducer
                  });
                  ```
              </section>
              <section data-markdown>
                  # Creating the Store
                  
                  Create a `src/redux/store.js` file now, the import redux into the file:
                  
                  ```js
                  import { createStore } from 'redux';
                  import rootReducer from './reducers';
                  
                  export default createStore(rootReducer);
                  ```
                  
                  ???
                  
                  - Remember that the store is where we ultimately keep all of our application state (it's the single source of state truth)
                  - Redux provides a `dispatch` method for updating the state in the store
                  - Redux also provides a `getState` method for getting state info from the store
                  - It allows us to register change listeners to update our views based on state using `subscribe`

                  # Exercise 3
                  
                  Now that you have your actions, reducers, and store created, you can actually dispatch actions to your store and get state from your store.
                  
                  Head over to `index.js` in the root of your app, import the store, import the action creator functions, then try dispatching the three actions and get something from the store:
                  
                  ```js
                  store.dispatch(getFruitCount());
                  store.dispatch(updateFruitStock(10));
                  store.dispatch(explainFruitStock());
                  // try console-logging something from the store with store.getState() 
                  ```

                  # What Just Happened?
                  
                  The data lifecycle in any Redux app follows these 4 steps:
                  
                  1. You called `store.dispatch(action)`
                  2. The Redux store called the reducer function you gave it
                  3. The root reducer combined the output of all reducers into a single state tree
                  4. The Redux store saved the complete state tree returned by the root reducer

                  # Subscribe to Changes
                  
                  To see each consecutive change made to the store, add the following code above your dispatches:
                  
                  ```js
                  let unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() =>
                    console.log(store.getState())
                  );
                  ```
                  
                  Then add this after the dispatches:
                  
                  ```js
                  unsubscribe();
                  ```
                  
                  Check out your console once your app refreshes.

                  # Exercise 4
                  
                  Console logs are fine, but there's a better way! Integrate your store with the [Redux Dev Tools extension now](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension).
                  
                  To do that you'll need to import `devToolsEnhancer` from `redux-devtools-extension` into `store.js` and then pass `devToolsEnhancer()` as a second argument to `createStore`.
                  
                  You'll know it's working when you can see the contents of your store in your browser's Redux dev tools.
