              ### Meteor is an open source platform for web, mobile, and desktop.
              
              And it's JavaScript all the way down!
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Application Platforms
              
              <img width="200px" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;" src="/public/img/slide-assets/swiss-army-knife.jpg" />
              
              An **Application Platform** is an *integrated set useful of programs*.
              
              Meteor comes with everything a JavaScript developer might need to build a fully functioning application, out of the box.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              Meteor simplifies and improves the *Developer Experience* of building Client-Server applications:
              
              - It's a complete and fully integrated suite of programs.
              - It's simple and powerful set of JavaScript API's for working with those programs.
              
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Exercise 1
              
              Split into two groups. Imagine you're planning an application platform for *other developers* to use. Your platform should be geared towards developers who want to create Web Apps and should include all the necessary components. Feel free to **invent or imagine technology or solutions that don't currently exist**
              
              When you've come up with a platform design, then come up with a marketing plan for your platform. When you have a marketing plan, you'll present it to the class. Your plan should highlight all of the reasons developers should choose your platform, over their own custom solution.

              # Client-Server Applications

          <section data-markdown>
              # What is Meteor?
              
              Under the hood, Meteor applications are typical Client-Server applications, like we're used to developing on the web.
              
              The Meteor platform includes:
              
              - Front-End tools for building a user interface: **Blaze/React/Angular**
              - Back-End tools for developing your database and Server-Side logic: **Node / MongoDB**
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Better than the REST?
              
              **So far in the course we've built a typical RESTful style Client-Server application.**
              
              This architecture has been in use for a long time. For experienced developers, the
              shortcomings of this type of application have become obvious, here are a few:
              
              - HTTP is a slow and bloated transport protocol
              - Client-Server applications don't share code!
              - UI's built over RESTful applications will need loading states everywhere!
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              Meteor was created to address these and many other shortcomings in typical Client-Server application architecture.

              # History of Meteor & MDG
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              **Meteor was created by some of the top developers in Silicon Valley...**
              
              - [Meteor is Open Source!](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/commit/4e4358e2c068ffd0c0bc565bb2a9438c68bab7fb)
              - Meteor was first introduced in 2011 under the name [Skybreak](https://blog.meteor.com/skybreak-is-now-meteor-e680d1dbaf84#.8iukm4iye).
              - The startup **The Meteor Development Group** (MDG) was incubated by Y Combinator.
              - In 2014, MDG acquired Y Combinator alum FathomDB.
              - In 2012 MDG received 11 million in funding from the investment firm *Andreessen Horowitz*.

              # Meteor's Parts
              
              Let's review the Awesome Meteor API Documentation and discuss the finer points of Meteor's API:
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              ### [The Meteor Guide](https://guide.meteor.com/)
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              ## Meteor, Atmosphere & NPM
              
              In 2011 NPM had not yet established itself as the de-facto package manager for Node applications.
              
              Because of Meteor unique architecture , and in order to preserve it's simple developer experience, while allowing
              3rd party developers to contribute useful packages for use with Meteor, MDG built a proprietary packaging system.
              
              The community responded by building a package hub called:
              ### [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/)
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              ## Meteor, Atmosphere & NPM
              
              As Meteor grew in popularity, the benefits of this system were soon overshadowed, by the demand from the JavaScript
              community at large, for NPM integration. Most JavaScript developers, especially those building software with Node,
              use NPM.
              
              The result is that there are 2 ways of acquiring packages to use with your Meteor Project.
              
              - Meteor's packaging system is still very useful, and you'll use it to add and remove all of the **Standard Packages**
              that come built into Meteor.

              # Deploying Meteor Apps
              
              Historically, Meteor has been difficult to deploy, because of it's unique architecture.
              This is no longer the case. MDG has created [Galaxy](https://www.meteor.com/hosting). An all in one paid hosting
              solution for Meteor apps.
              
              The Open Source community has also built deployment solutions. The 2 most popular are:
              - [MUP](https://github.com/zodern/meteor-up) Built by Arounoda Surispala, a hero in the Meteor OS community.
              - [meteor-now](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meteor-now) Built on the fantastic **[Now](https://zeit.co/now)** Node deployment tool.
              Install Now and deploy your example app to see just how easy it is...

              # Meteor's Parts
              
              Based on our review of the API, let's attempt to answer the following questions:
              
              - How does Meteor address some of the shortcomings we mentioned earlier?
              - What are some of the innovative or unusual aspects of Meteor's API?
              - What are some of the important Deployment gotchas involved in running a production Meteor application?
              - How will working with Meteor make our lives as Full-Stack JavaScript Developers more sane?
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Exercise 2
              
              Install Meteor and run `meteor create`.
              
              See if you can add the following features to the example project that is generated:
              
              - A button that decrements the counter
              - A text input and button combination. When the user clicks the button, whatever text
              is in the input appears on screen.
              
              Install the Meteor Dev Tools Chrome extension, and observe Meteor's DDP websocket
              transport protocol in action! Open the mongoDB shell using the `meteor mongo` command
              and take a peek at your new mongoDB database.

              Now that we know a little bit about What Meteor does, watch the following short Video on Fibers & Futures in Node, for some insight on how it does it:

              # Benefits of Meteor
              
              - No loading!
              - Send less data!
              - Reactive!
              - So many sensible defaults!
              - Fast TTL!

              # Drawbacks of Meteor
              
              - Black box magical API's
              - JS Ecosystem interop
              - mongoDB by default
              - Performance gotchas
              - Deployment
              - Doesn't work seamlessly with all JS
