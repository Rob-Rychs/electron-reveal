              ### Coding Interviews
              
              **Fun Fact**: The code you'll actually be writing on the job is not at all like the code you'll be asked to write for an interview.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Coding Interviews
              
              - Often computer science-heavy (less so for juniors)
              - Focus on devil-in-the-details problems
              - Are as much about **how you write code** as they are about **what code you write**
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Format
              
              - First interview: usually with HR or Recruitment for **fit**
              - **Take-home programming task**, due within 1-3 days
              - Second interview, **whiteboarding/live coding**
              - Depending on the company, they might have more live coding interviews
              - Meeting with CEO or CTO for **final decision**

            The discussing here should be around getting some way of 'testing' whether code is done.
            
            - Are you logging to the console?
            - Are you rendering UI and checking it?
            - Are either of the above efficient? Can they be automated?

            Basically what we're talking about is the feedback loop.
            
            - You write or change code
            - You run the code in whatever environment you've built
            - You get feedback as to whether or not it works

              So how do we make that feedback loop smaller?

            ???
            
            We're going to learn how to run **unit tests**, which mean that we are only executing the code that we're writing, and nothing else. This makes the feedback loop tiny, we can run hundreds of tests in a couple seconds.
            
            Let's start with an exercise...

              # Example Question
              
              *This is an example coding test question...*
              
              A frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position `start` and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to `end`. The frog always jumps a fixed distance, `jumpLength`.
              
              Write a function to count the minimal number of jumps that the frog must perform to reach its target.

              In groups:
              
              - Use the whiteboard to draw out some examples of the jumping frog algorithm
              - Write out a specification for the `frogJumps` function **in plain English**. Use the format:
              
              ```
              [Function name]
              
              When [given some input(s)] it should [return something].
              When [given some other input(s)] it should [return something else].

              # Our First Unit Test
              
              We've talked about how `frogJumps` works.
              
              Let's use TDD to write it! 
              
              Step 1 is to write a test. Here's an example:
              
              ```js
              // __tests__/frog-jumps.spec.js
              const frogJumps = require('../lib/frog-jumps.js');
              
              describe('frogJumps', () => {
              
                describe('when start is equal to end', () => {
                  it('should return 0', () => {
                    const result = frogJumps(10, 10, 5);
                    expect(result).toEqual(0);
                  });
                });
              
              });
              ```
              
              ???
              
              This might look like a lot of syntax right off the bat, but you'll get used to the pattern.

              # Anatomy of a Test
              
              We're using **[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)** to write tests. Read the docs!
              
              To make our tests match our Plain English specs, we use nested `describe` blocks. The `describe` takes a callback function as its second argument, allowing us to group tests with a similar context.
              
              ```js
              describe('Outer context', () => {
                // Code/Tests specific to outer context
              
                describe('Middle context', () => {
                  // Code/Tests specific to middle context
              
                  describe('Inner context', () => {
                    // Code/Tests specific to inner context
                  });
                });
              });
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Anatomy of a Test
              
              Nesting callbacks is generally considered bad practice outside of writing tests, so you'll need to get used to the difference.
              
              If your code is indented properly, you will see a series of closing parens/braces in a 45 degree angle at the end of a file.
              
               ```js
                  // Good
                  });
                });
              });
              
                  // Probably a bug
                  });
              });
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Anatomy of a Test
              
              When we pass strings to `describe` (other than the outermost `describe`) we use the format `when [some context]`:
              
              ```js
              describe('functionName', () => {
                describe('when passed a certain type of argument', () => {
                  // Test here
                });
              });
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Anatomy of a Test
              
              We write our actual tests (aka **assertions**) using `it` blocks. It blocks are given a string of the format `should [return something]`.
              
              Within an `it`, we use the `expect` function with various **matchers**:
              
              ```js
              it('should return true', () => {
                // 'toBe' matcher
                expect(result).toBe(true);
              });
              
              it('should return 100', () => {
                // 'toEqual' matcher
                expect(result).toEqual(100);
              });
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Anatomy of a Test
              
              Bringing it together:
              
              ```js
              // __tests__/frog-jumps.spec.js
              const frogJumps = require('../lib/frog-jumps.js');
              
              // Outer describe
              describe('frogJumps', () => {
              
                // Inner describe 'context'
                describe('when start is equal to end', () => {
              
                  // Test
                  it('should return 0', () => {
              
                    // Assertion
                    expect(frogJumps(10, 10, 5)).toEqual(0);
                  });
                });
              
              });

              # Running Your Test
              
              The test on the previous slide uses the **[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)** testing library.
              
              Jest has a command line tool, but in order to execute it in the proper environment we need to execute it as a node script.
              
              In your `package.json`:
              
              ```js
              {
                ...
                "scripts": {
                  "test": "jest --verbose"
                }
              }
              
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Code Along
              
              Run your test:
              
              ```bash
              npm run test
              
              # or
              npm test
              
              # or even
              npm t
              ```
              
              *The test will fail, obviously!*
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>

            <strong><span style="color: red">FAIL</span> -> <span style="color: green">PASS</span></strong>
            ]

            ???

            What we need to do now is write the minimal amount of code in order to get the test to pass.

            - Start by running the test. It will fail because the file doesn't exist
            - Add the file, run the test again, it will fail because the function is undefined
            - Add a function with the correct name, but no body, it will fail because the return value is undefined
            - Write minimal code to get the scenario to pass, then run the test
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Add Another Test
              
              ```js
              describe('when destination is exactly one jump away', () => {
                it('should return 1', () => {
                  expect(frogJumps(5, 15, 10)).toEqual(1);
                });
              });
              ```
              
              Run your tests, and fix the errors.
              
              ???
              
              - Make sure the students follow TDD step by step: only do things that error messages tell you to do
              - You can take shortcuts once you're better at this
              - Once all the tests pass, you KNOW your code is done

              - We write MINIMAL code to make it pass (GREEN)

              # Exercise 2
              
              Implement unit tests for each of the specifications you wrote for `frogJumps`.
              
              Think about the **Edge Cases**
              
              - Zero Arguments
              - Perfect match
              - Maximum Match
              - No Match
              
              ???
              
              - Give them maybe 30 minutes of supported work
              - They will struggle with the syntax, so make sure you help out a lot
              - Encourage them to run tests after every change

              # Exercise 3
              
              A palindrome is a string that is the same when written forwards and backwards.
              **Mom**, **racecar**, and **never odd or even** are all palindromes.
              
              Write a function that takes a string and returns whether it is a palindrome. Take these steps to do so:
              
              - Whiteboard the algorithm
              - Write out plain English specs
              - Convert specs to tests
              - Implement your algorithm
              
              ???
              
              - Get them to work on this by themselves
              - Get them to each read out a test scenario
              
              Once they start working, start hinting at complexity of algorithms.
