              1. Install and create an Express app
              2. Create a "Hello World" server using Express
              3. Create an Express middleware
              4. Parse requests coming into Express
              5. Explore REST (in relation to Express)

              # Exercise 1
              
              Before we begin creating an Express web server, in pairs draw a diagram of a client-server application. Be sure to diagram the lines of communication, and be as detailed as possible. Label as many things as you can.

              - How do servers and clients communicate with each other?

              # Communication
              
              **HTTP** and **Web Sockets** are the most common protocols for communicating between web servers and clients.
              
              *Explain the following analogies:*
              
              1. HTTP is like sending a piece of mail
              2. Web Sockets is like a text message or a phone call
              
              ???
              
              - Web sockets...a way to receive event-driven response without polling (set up a persistent connection so either client or server can send data at anytime)
              - i.e. bidirectional, low latency real-time communication
              - How? Send an HTTP request with `Connection: Upgrade` header to URL with `ws://` scheme

              > "HTTP and HTML are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of Internet protocols, only comprehensible as elaborate practical jokes. For anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious on the Web, it's pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide hypertext protocol, we have the worst one possible.
              
              > Except, of course, for all the others."

              ???
              
              - HTTP is a "glue" protocol
              - Inter-operability because it is weak, relatively uncoordinated, and imperfectly implemented
              - HTTP kills all other protocols BECAUSE OF the simplicity of its labelling system

              # HTTP Conceptually
              
              Think of every HTTP request or response as an **envelop**. 
              
              What's on the envelop is information about where it should go (the **path**), a description of what's inside (some **headers**), what we want done to the contents of the envelop when it gets to its destination (the **HTTP verb**), or what happened to during its trip (the **status code**).
              
              What's inside the envelop is the actual message/document (the **body**).
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # HTTP Essentials
              
              Take a look in your dev tools under the Network tab, and look at the Header sub-tab for one of the requests that was sent while loading the page.
              
              What are the first three things you see listed under General?
              
              ???
              
              - Request URL, Request Method, Status Code
              - These are some of the essential components of HTTP requests and responses
              
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # URIs
              
              - Every resource on the web must be exposed with **at least one unique identifier** (but possible many unique identifiers)
              - If a resource doesn't have URI then it's not a resource (it's likely just information about another resource)
              - An **addressable** application exposes interesting aspects of its data set as resources, and exposes URIs for all of the resources it may conceivably serve
              
              ???
              
              - URIs don't belong specifically to HTTP, but HTTP uses them
              - Uniform Resource Identifier vs. Locator: every URL is URI, every URI on the web is a URL, but not all URI are URLs
              - URLs don't just identify resources like URIs do, they also indicate where to find them (like describing a person by their name instead of resident of their physical address)

              # HTTP Verbs
              
              What do we use the following **[HTTP verbs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)** for?
              
              - `GET`
              - `POST`
              - `PUT`
              - `PATCH`
              - `DELETE`
              
              ???
              
              - It's up to you to choose the right verb when you send your request, and the verb that you choose will have consequences!
              - HTTP verbs provide us with a uniform interface when structuring our applications (as in there aren't many of these verbs and we know what they do in advance)
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # HTTP Status Code
              
              How would we describe these **[status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)** in non-colloquial terms?
              
              - `100`: Hold on
              - `200`: Here you go
              - `300`: Go away
              - `400`: You messed up
              - `500`: I messed up
              
              ???
              
              - Responding appropriately (i.e. correct status code / message) when a request comes into our Express server will be our job

              # What is Express?
              
              - It's minimal, flexible abstraction layer on top of Node
              - Handy framework for creating web APIs
              - [Other frameworks](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/frameworks.html) are written on top of it too
              - Allows us to do routing, create/use middleware, and use template engines to generate HTML pages
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Initial Set-up
              
              Create a new directory with an `index.js` file, and then run through `npm init` in that directory.
              
              Once that's done, run:
              
              ```bash
              npm i -S express
              ```
              
              More on [Express installation instructions here](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html).

          <section data-markdown>
              # Initial Set-up
              
              Let's also use Babel with our app:
              
              ```bash
              npm i -D babel-cli babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-stage-2 nodemon
              ```
              
              The [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) package will allow us to watch files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, it will automatically restart our Node application.
              
              **Note:** If we were deploying this app we would want to create a build command as it is not recommended to run `babel-node` in production.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Initial Set-up
              
              Create a Babel config file:
              
              ```bash
              touch .babelrc
              ```
              
              Add to `.babelrc`:
              
              ```
              {
                "presets": ["es2015", "stage-2"],
                "plugins": []
              }
              ```
              
              And in `package.json`:
              
              ```
              "scripts": {
                "start": "nodemon index.js --exec babel-node"
              }
              ```

          <section data-markdown>
              # A Basic Express App
              
              Below, the `app.get()` method create a route that accepts GET requests:
              
              ```js
              import express from 'express';
              const app = express();
              const port = 3300;
              
              app.get('/', function(request, response) {
                response.send('Hello, world!');
              });
              
              app.listen(port, function() {
                console.log(`Server running @ localhost:${port}`);
              });
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Does It Work?
              
              Run the following in your Terminal:
              
              ```bash
              curl -i http://localhost:3300
              ```
              
              *What do you see?*
              
              ???
              
              - `ETag`: can be used for web cache validation
              - `Connection: keep-alive`: Persist connection to improve performance of multiple requests
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # It's Just Node!
              
              Remember that Express is just providing an abstraction layer on top of Node, so we can still use the Node API in our route handlers too:
              
              ```js
              app.get('/', function(request, response) {
                // Express method:
                // response.send('Hello, world!');
              
                // Almost-equivalent code with regular Node:
                response.write('Hello, world!');
                response.end();
              });
              ```
              
              ???
              
              - If you were to dig into the Express code you would see that the `request` and `response` objects have prototypes that are based on objects from the Node `http` library.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Send Some JSON
              
              The `.send()` method converts an array or object to JSON:
              
              ```js
              const quotes = [
                { 
                  name: 'Fred Brooks',
                  text: 'Nine people can’t make a baby in a month.'
                },
                { 
                  name: 'Paul Ford',
                  text: 'A computer is a clock with benefits.'
                },
                { 
                  name: 'Linus Torvalds',
                  text: 'Talk is cheap. Show me the code.'
                }
              ];
              
              app.get('/', function(request, response) {
                response.send(quotes);
              }); // ...now run `curl -i` again
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Add a Route
              
              We can respond to request on more than just the root-level URI too (thankfully!). Create a dedicated route to send our quotes JSON back on:
              
              ```js
              app.get('/quotes', function(request, response) {
                response.send(quotes);
              });
              ```

              # Middleware in Express
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Middleware?
              
              Middleware are simply **functions added to the call stack that have access to the request and response objects, and are executed sequentially** (before `app.get()`, etc. is called).
              
              Express middleware can perform the following tasks:
              
              - Execute any code
              - Make changes to the request and the response objects
              - End the request-response cycle
              - Call the next middleware in the stack
              
              ???
              
              - Redux middleware solves different problems than Express middleware, but in a conceptually similar way
              - In Redux, middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer
              - In Express, middleware provides a third-party extenion point between the raw request and the final request handler.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Using Middleware
              
              We can apply middleware in Express as follows:
              
              ```js
              app.use(function(request, response, next) {
                // Do something here...
                // then move to next middleware...
                next();
              });
              
              app.use(function(request, response, next) {
                // ...
                response.send();
              });
              ```
              
              The call to `next()` is how we move onto the next piece of middleware, until we're finally ready to respond back to the client and call `response.send()` in the last middleware.
              
              ???
              
              - Once `response.send()` is called you can’t apply more middleware
              - You can also specify a route for a first argument of `.use()` to only run the middleware function on that route, otherwise it will run on for all requests
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Built-in Middleware
              
              The only middleware function that ships with Express 4.x+ is `static()`. This function makes it possible to serve static assets in your app:
              
              ```js
              // Serve files from the "public" dir:
              app.use(express.static('public'));
              ```
              
              Try replacing your call to `app.get('/', ...)` with this in your Express app. Be sure to add a `public` directory with an `index.html` file in it. What do you see in your browser now?
              
              ???
              
              - The static middleware will serve everything under the public folder
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Exercise 2
              
              Before we go further with middleware, let's pause an build out the client side of our app. In your `index.html` file, add a button (which you will use to asynchronously retrieve quotes).
              
              Also create `main.js` file in your `public` directory and include it in your `index.html` file. Inside of `main.js`, use `fetch` to grab your quotes on JSON when the button is clicked.
              
              Lastly, append all the quotes and their authors to the DOM after the `fetch` Promise resolves successfully.

              ```js
              function appendQuote(quote) {
                const blockquote = document.createElement('blockquote');
                const deleteButton = document.createElement('button');
                deleteButton.setAttribute('data-quote', quote.name.replace(/\s+/g, '-').toLowerCase());
                deleteButton.textContent = 'Delete';
                blockquote.textContent = `"${quote.text}" — ${quote.name} `;
                blockquote.appendChild(deleteButton);
                container.appendChild(blockquote);
              }
              ```

              Like with React Router, we can add route parameters:
              
              ```js
              app.get('/quotes/:name', function(request, response) {

              What do you see in your browser now when you navigate to `/quotes/someone`?
              
              ???

              app.get('/quotes/:name', function(request, response) {
                const { name } = request.params;

              Doing this in our Express app will be similar to sending `GET` requests, but we'll use a `POST` request instead.
              
              *But first, some initial set-up...*

              # Submit Form
              
              First, we'll need a form to send `POST` requests to our server from the client:
              
              ```html
              <h2>Submit a Quote</h2>
              <form id="create-quote">
                <label for="text">Quote Text</label>
                <input type="text" id="text" name="text">
                <label for="name">Speaker Name</label>
                <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
                <button type="submit">Create Quote</button>

          <section data-markdown>
              # Event Handler
              
              In our client-side JS, you'll also need to listen for the `submit` event on the form:
              
              ```js
              const createQuoteForm = document.getElementById('create-quote');
              
              createQuoteForm.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
                event.preventDefault();
                const formData = new FormData(createQuoteForm);
                const newQuote = {};
              
                for ([key, value] of formData.entries()) {
                  newQuote[key] = value;
                }
              
                // Now use fetch to send a post request to finish the job...
              });
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Exercise 6
              
              Before we handle the `POST` request in Express, we'll need a way to send that request from the client to our server. 
              
              Inside of the submit event handler, use `fetch` to send a `POST` request. You'll need to send it to the `/quotes` route. 
              
              **Note**: You will also need to supply some request options in the form of an object as a second argument to `fetch`. You'll want to specify that the `method` is `POST`, set `headers` for the `Content-Type` (JSON), and set the `newQuote` object as the `body` (use `JSON.stringify()`).
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # POST Requests
              
              Now we finally get to handle the `POST` request we're sending from the client. First, we'll need some middleware to parse the JSON body of the incoming request:
              
              ```js
              npm install --save body-parser
              ```
              
              Now add this to your Express app:
              
              ```js
              import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
              
              app.post('/quotes', bodyParser.json(), function (request, response) {
                const newQuote = request.body;
                // Add your new quote to the quotes array
                // Then send back a 201 status
                // And also send the new quote as JSON in the response
              });
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Exercise 7
              
              Now figure out how to finish writing the route handler for the `POST` request.
              
              Once you've finished that, jump back to your client-side JS and take the JSON response you get back from the server to append your new quote to the DOM.
              
              Improve UX by clearing out the form inputs after the response comes back too!

              # Remove a Quote
              
              The last bit of functionality will be to delete individual quote from the list. We'll submit our request from the client like this:
              
              ```js
              const container = document.getElementById('quotes');
              
              container.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
                const clickedEl = event.target;
              
                if (clickedEl.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
                  const name = clickedEl.getAttribute('data-quote');
              
                  fetch(`http://localhost:3300/quotes/${name}`, {
                    method: 'DELETE'
                  })
                    .then(() => {
                      const blockquote = clickedEl.parentNode;
                      blockquote.parentNode.removeChild(blockquote);
                    });
                }
              });
              ```

              # DELETE Requests
              
              Not surprisingly, you'll handle a `DELETE` request like this in Express:
              
              ```js
              app.delete(function (request, response) {
                // Remove the quote from the quotes array
                // Send back the 200 status with the response
              });
              ```

              # Bonus Round: Clean-up
              
              There's a way we can consolidate route code so that we're not making isolated calls to HTTP verb-related Express methods on the same routes.
              
              Also, the `index.js` file in our Express app is getting a bit messy. Typically, you wouldn't define all of your routes for an app in this top-level file. There's a built-in solution in Express for that as well.
              
              *Let's do some refactoring...*
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Use app.route()
              
              Right now we have this in our app:
              
              ```js
              app.get('/quotes', /* handler */ );
              app.post('/quotes', /* handler */ );
              app.get('/quotes/:name', /* handler */ );
              app.delete('/quotes/:name', /* handler */ );
              ```
              
              But we can use `app.route()` to consolidate our route handling with chaining:
              
              ```js
              app.route('/quotes')
                .get( /* handler */ )
                .post( /* handler */ );
              
              app.route('/quotes/:name')
                .get( /* handler */ )
                .delete( /* handler */ );
              ```
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Exercise 9
              
              Refactor your route-related code to use `app.route()`.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Routes in a Module
              
              It would also be nice to get all of the route handling code out of `index.js` into a dedicated module for quotes.
              
              Create a `quotes.js` file in your Express app and add:
              
              ```js
              import express from 'express';
              import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
              
              const router = express.Router();
              
              // ...some code goes here
              
              export default router;
              ```
              
              ???
              
              - Creates modular, mountable route handlers
              - A Router instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a “mini-app”
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Refactor Routes
              
              Now mount your router in your app:
              
              ```js
              import quotesRoutes from './quotes';
              
              // ...
              
              app.use('/quotes', quoteRoutes)
              ```
              
              And move all of the `app.route()` calls `quotes.js`.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Exercise 10
              
              Our app won't work until we refactor what we just moved into `./quotes.js`.
              
              First, we won't call `.route()` on the `app` object (it doesn't exist here), we'll call it on the instance of the router we instantiated in this file (`router`).
              
              Second, the path argument passed into `.route()` will be relative to where it's mounted in `index.js`. What do we need to change in the path argument to reflect this?
              
              Don't forget to move your quotes array into `quotes.js` too!

              - REST isn't an architecture, it's meant to be a way to judge architectures (i.e. it's a set of design criteria)
              - It's resource-driven, like the web

              A few events contributed to the rise of REST:
              
              - The ubiquity of smartphones (iPhone launched in 2007)
              - Social media platforms (the witter sort-of-REST-ish API was a way to combat rogue API implementations)
              - Cloud computing (Amazon S3 launched in 2006 and initially didn't have a GUI, just a RESTful API)

              # How REST Works
              
              REST defines a type of architecture where **resources**, **identifiers** (URIs), and **actions** (HTTP verbs) are all we need to interact with resources hosted on the web.
              
              In other words, HTTP verbs provide semantic intention for the actions we want to take on resources, and URIs help us know where to find them.
              
              Taken together, REST enabled us to use the web as a **distributed application plaform** whose **linked resources** communicate by **exchanging representations of resource state**.

              How a data set splits into resources:
              
              1. Pre-defined/one-off resources for important aspects of the application (e.g. the homepage)
              2. Resources for every object exposed through the service (possibly infinite)
              3. Resources as a result of algorithms applied to data sets (probably infinite)

              # RESTful URIs
              
              And we describe our resources with URI structure:
              
              - Use path variables to denote hierarchy (e.g. `/parent/child`)
              - Use punctuation to avoid implying hierarchy where one doesn't exist (e.g. `lat,long` or `lat;long`)
              - Use a query string as a input to an algorithm (e.g. `?search=`)

              # Exercise 11
              
              In small groups or pairs, you'll be assigned one of the following topics to research (with respect to how it relates to REST) and deliver a short presentation to class on your findings:
              
              - Data versus Resources versus Representations in REST
              - State in REST: The idea of "statelessness" and the difference between resource state and application state
              - The Richardson Maturity Model and where "hypermedia as an engine of application state" (HATEOAS) comes into play
              - Safety and idempotence of HTTP verbs used in REST APIs
              
              ???
              
              **Data v. Resources v. Representations:**
              
              - Resource: a document, a row in a database, the results of running an algorithm, etc. (anything that can be streamed as bits)
              - Splitting an app into resources increases its surface area
              - Representation: any useful information about the state of the resource
              - Representations also provide levers of state (the next possible state)
              - Representations help capture the current or intended sate of a resource (with metadata) (we represent with JSON)
              
              **State in REST:**
              
              - Statelessness: request happen in isolation of each other and contain all the info they necessary to get what's needed from the server
              - The client doesn't need to coax the server into some state for the server to be receptive to a request
              - HTTP sessions on the server can break statelessness
              - Statelessness makes it easier to cache and scale a distributed app
              - Application state should be managed in the client, and reflects interactions
              - Resource state should be managed on the server, and reflects the semi-permanent state of data
              - Resource state is the same for every client
              
              
              **RMM & HATEOAS:**
              
              - Level 0: URI tunneling
              - Level 1: Resources
              - Level 2: HTTP verbs
              - Level 3: Hypermedia
              - HATEOAS: App state tracked by the client on its path through the web (the server guides it along the path through links and forms)
              - As an app reaches a new state, the next possible states are discovered (like a treasure hunt for nearby resources)
              
              **Safety & Idempotence:**
              
              - Safe: no server-side effects for which the client can be held responsible
              - Idempotent: generates absolute side effects
              - GET is safe and idempotent
              - PUT and DELETE are not safe but idempotent
              - PATCH and POST are not safe and not idempotent
              - POST overload in RPC
              - POST is often used as the wildcard operation of the web
              - In REST, POST is for creating subordinate resources
