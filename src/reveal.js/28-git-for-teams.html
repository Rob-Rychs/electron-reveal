              #Exercise 1
              
              Everyone is tasked with making a website for our class. This site must be about Git and the benefits of using it. Everyone must collaborate on it. 
              
              The process will consist of 4 separate 5 minute stages. 
              1. Everyone is working on creating the site separately.
              2. Everyone will zip their files over to an elected person. This person will work on merging all the files into one. The remaining people will continue on improving the site. 
              3. Rotate until everyone has had a chance to merge.

              #Exercise 2
              
              How would you create version control?
              
              Spend a few minutes writing down all the features you would like your version control to have. Specifically tailor it to a team environment.

              #Contributing
              
              Problem - You have a project that you want contribution from other people. What features would you include, how would it work?
              
              1. Will this work for a group of 5 and a group of 1000?
              2. Does everyone have write access? How are patches reviewed?
