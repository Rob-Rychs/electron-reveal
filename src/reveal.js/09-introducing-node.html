              # What is Node?
              
              - Node was created in **2009**
              - It has become the driving force behind the widespread adoption of the JS programming language as a tool for developing sophisticated software applications
              - Provides the **minimum viable foundation** to support the main Internet protocols, and OS interface
              - Given its low-level API, any reasonably complex application needs to make extensive use of libraries (npm!)
          </section>

              # Experienced Node Developers Know...
              
              - How to structure an application using multiple third-party modules, and how to reliably judge the quality of a third-party module
              - How to leverage the **event loop** and Node's **async**, single-threaded nature (more on this to come...)
              - How to use various networking protocols

              ### What Makes It So Special?
              
              *Node's most useful features are...*
              
              The **event loop** and **non-blocking I/O**.
              
              Node programs are **single threaded** and **highly parallel**.

              # Building a TCP Service
              
              TCP and UDP are the basic protocols of the internet.
              
              **All network communication on the internet is carried out by these two protocols (for the most part).**
              
              Take a minute to **[read this link](http://www.diffen.com/difference/TCP_vs_UDP)**, for a good description of the differences between TCP & UPD, and how they are used.
              
              When you're finished, create a folder called `TCP_Service`. Inside the folder run the command `npm init`.
          </section>

              # Building a TCP Service
              
              Your `package.json` should look like this:
              
              ```json
              {
                "name": "intro-to-node-exercises",
                "version": "1.0.0",
                "description": "Learning Node @ Red Academy",
                "scripts": {
                  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
                },
                "author": "MK <mackenzie@redacademy.com>",
                "license": "ISC"
              }
              ```
              
              **Why do we need this?**

              # Building a TCP Service
              
              Create a file called `index.js`. Use Node's [built-in `net` module](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html) to create a server which will handle incoming network connections (TCP/UDP):
              
              ```js
              const net = require('net')
              const server = net.createServer();
              
              server.on('connection', handleConnection);
              
              server.listen(9000, function() {
                console.log('server listening to %j', server.address());
              });
              
              function handleConnection() {
                // TODO: Handle connection!
              }
              ```
              
              Run this code by typing `node index.js`.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Building a TCP Service
              
              In order to show when the **server** has received a connection from a **client**, we'll need to add some code to the `handleConnection` callback.
              
              ```js
              function handleConnection(conn) {
                const remoteAddress = `${conn.remoteAddress}:${conn.remotePort}`;
                console.log(`new client connection from ${remoteAddress}`);
              }
              ```
              
              Add the `conn` parameter and `console.log` connection details when a connection happens.
              
              *Where is the client?*
              
              **Note:** Socket in this context is not WebSocket.

              # Simple Netcat Client
              
              **We'll use Netcat to test our nre TCP/UDP server.**
              
              Start your server new TCP Server, and from your command line in a separate terminal window, run:
              
              ```bash
              nc localhost 9000
              ```
              
              You should see something like this in the terminal where your server was started:
              
              ```bash
              new client connection from ::1:63342
              ```
              
              Take a few minutes and read about the [Netcat](http://nc110.sourceforge.net/) tool now.

              ### Congratulations, you've successfully created a new network 'node' and connected it to the internet!
              
              <p style="text-align:center; margin:0;">
                <img style="display:inline;" src="http://cheswick.com/ches/map/gallery/wired.gif" width="250" height="250">

              It doesn't do anything useful yet.
              Before we can start sending and receiving data, we'll need to add a few more things...
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Exercise 1
              
              Implement the following `conn` event handlers in your `handleConnection` callback:
              
              - `data`
              - `close`
              - `error`
              
              Each handler should `console.log` the `remoteAddress` as well as any relevant parameters (e.g. incoming data, or error messages). Review **[the documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html)** here before you begin.

              # UTF-8
              
              If you're sending incoming data to the server console, you may have noticed somthing like this `<Buffer 9c 4f 4f 4f>` in the output.
              
              This happens because TCP sends **streams of bytes** across the network, and it's up to our application to decode them properly.
              
              *But what is UTF-8?*

              # V8 Inspector Integration
              
              To debug a Node application, start the node process using the following command:
              
              ```bash
              node --debug --inspect index.js
              ```
              
              You should see output in your terminal:
              
              ```bash
              Debugger listening on port 9229.
              Warning: This is an experimental feature and could change at any time.
              To start debugging, open the following URL in Chrome:
                  chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html?experiments=true&v8only=true&ws=127.0.0.1:9229/3b270900-1c51-460c-a7a4-d593f462b2d7
              ```
              
              Copy and paste the `chrome-devtools://` url into a new chrome tab to start your debugging session.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              Open your debugger and set a breakpoint somewhere in your code. Send a message to your server using Netcat to trigger it.

          <section data-markdown>
              # Exercise 2
              
              Use the debugger and set a breakpoint in your `data` event handler. Intercept the incoming data, and use the debugger's console to change the value of the data parameter (the incoming data) before it's logged.
              
              Use [Netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) to send data to your new TCP service.

              # Completed TCP Service
              
              Finally, lets return some data from our service. At the moment does not send any information back to the client.
              
              Add the following code to your `data` handler to complete the service:
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Completed TCP Service
              
              Finally, lets return some data from our service. At the moment does not send any information back to the client.
              
              Add the following code to your `data` handler to complete the service:
              
              ```js
              // console.log ...
              conn.write(
                `Got "${d.trim()}". Let me uppercase: "${d.toUpperCase()}"`
              )
              ```
              
              Now we have a friendly upper-casing service.

              # Blocking & Non-Blocking Operations
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Exercise 3
              
              Use your TCP server to read from your local file system. When your server receives a request, use Node's build in `fs` module to read text from a `.txt` file and send the contents back to the connection.
              
              - Is reading from the filesystem an **async** or **sync** action?
              - In what circumstance is it useful to use blocking operations?
              
              Modify your existing code:
              
              ```js
              function handleConnection(conn) {
                // TODO: Read a welcome message from your filesystem
                // And respond to the connection with the contents
              }
              ```
          </section>

              Change your TCP service to deliver any incoming data to all connected clients.
              
              - Your server will need to store all connections
              - Messages you send to the server should not return to you
