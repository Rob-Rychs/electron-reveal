              ### FP FTW!
              
              Functional programming is a **programming paradigm** just like object-oriented or procedural programming is.
              
              In functional programming, computation is treated as **the transformation of data through functions**.

              # How Is It Different?
              
              Some characteristics of functional programming include:
              
              - Use of pure functions
              - Avoids shared state, mutable data, and side effects
              - Declarative (using expressions) instead of imperative (using statements)
              
              ???
              
              - Question to class: explain the different between declarative and imperative programming
              - What are the relative pros and cons of each? e.g. Abstraction vs. efficiency
              
              Functional vs. OOP:
              
              - IN OOP, objects are little state machines.
              - In FP, functions take in state and return new state.

              # Sidebar: FP Origins
              
              **Lambda Calculus!**
              
              Functional programming traces its roots back to the Lambda calculus was invented by Alonzo Church in the 1930s.
              
              It treats **functions as black boxes**&mdash;it takes inputs to functions and processes them in some way and gives you a single output. 
              
              Functions are also **meant to be pure**, so they have no internal state (i.e. no hidden information).
              
              Ultimately, it gives us **a way to encode any computation.**
              
              ???
              
              Lambda calculus is the basis of all functional programming languages, and now can be found in most programming languages.
              
              Lambda calculus essentially consists of three things:
              
              1. Variables
              2. A way of building functions
              3. A way of applying functions
              
              Any Turning Machine program can be translated into Lambda calculus, and vice versa (potential inefficiency aside).

              # Lambda Calculus
              
              - In Lambda calculus, **functions are just like numbers and numbers are just like functions** (in fact, you don't even need numbers!)
              - Functions can consume other functions as arguments, and produce other functions as arguments as results (aka **higher order functions**)
              - It has interesting implications, like the Y-combinator (invented by Haskell Curry), which is a way to do **recursion** in a language that doesn't have any looping or recursion mechanism (written as `Y = λf.(λx.f(xx))(λx.f(xx))`)
              
              ???
              
              Talk about "first class functions" in JS:
              
              - JS supports constructing new functions during the execution of a program, storing them in data structures, passing them as arguments to other functions, and returning them as the values of other functions
              
              Talk about "higher order functions" in JS:
              
              - Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them
              - Where have you seen higher order functions in use (event handlers, map, filter, reduce, etc.)

              # FP in the Wild
              
              Some languages that are highly functional in nature include Clojure, Erlang, F#, and Haskell.
              
              Other languages (like JS!) support a functional programming style to varying degrees (even PHP).
              
              Support for **first-class functions** and **higher-order functions** in the language is key!
              
              ???
              
              - JS has properties of an untyped functional language
              - But it can also be used in an OOP or imperative way

          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              ### Functional programming is about writing *pure* functions.
              
              *Fill in the blank:*
              
              **Pure functions are...**
              
              ???
              
              Straight out of pre-work reading...
              
              - Portable / Self-documenting
              - Testable
              - Cacheable (by input)
              - Referentially transparent, which means it can be substituted for its evaluated value without changing the behavior of the program
              - Parallelizable
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Pure Function Structure
              
              A pure function has three parts:
              
              ```
              1. Input(s)
                    |
                    V
              2. Transformation
                    |
                    V
              3. Output(s)
              ```
              
              ???
              
              - Remember that it's meant to be a self-contained black box!
              - This function should not produce any side effects in the outside world
              - So no matter how many times you run the function with the same inputs you should get the same output
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
              # Pure or Impure?
              
              Determine whether the following functions are **pure** or **impure**. 
              
              Be sure to justify your reasons as we will be discussing these as a class afterward.

              # Exercise 1
              
              Create examples of pure functions in JavaScript for each of the following cases:
              
              1. A function used as an input to another function
              2. A function created as an output from another function
              3. A function that calls itself
              
              Be prepared to demo your functions for the class.

              Into `[8, 6, 4, 2]` using array methods and **only one line of code**. Do not mutate the original `list` array!
              
              Once you figure this out, add `.sort()` to the end of your array method chain.
              
              Now add `10` to the original list. What happens when you sort it now? Why do you think this happens?

              Flatten then add together this array using `.reduce()`, so:
              
              `[[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]]`
              
              Becomes this:
              
              `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
              
              Then this:
              
              `15`

              # Immutability
              
              Functional programming avoids mutatable data because mutating data in your program makes it harder to read and more error-prone.
              
              Using `const` does not solve this problem, because `const` only creates an *immutable binding*.
              
              ```
              const person = {};
              person.name = 'Bob'; // this is fine! 
              person = 'Bob'; // this is not fine
              ```

              In small groups, you'll have 15 minutes to understand your assigned topic (in relation to avoiding mutating object data) and teach it to the class using examples:
              
              1. `Object.assign`
              2. `...` spread operator
              3. `Object.freeze`
